good day , ladies , gentlemen .
now , thank you for the subject line here today to talk .
and i have to me , yes now -- imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , even term , <unk> in the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is first of them , is an organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , you make , not quite popular .
i know .
and beyond that , and that 's something which my son , particularly liked it , i also <unk> .
that means i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and half <unk> .
and have i thought , is a subject matter , i want you today <unk> want .
what happened with the theme of selectmen because , that are supposed to fire .
we hope for the best and for us on the worst ago , that 's what jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't quite so serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a position .

many people are the way .
it is , , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any time .
suddenly an announcement .
leave you that <unk> .
police comes to fire , <unk> .
people .
who honking .
, get out .
what 's because this ? , asking passersby .
you that we also not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some of falling off , i , because it all very quickly go to .
suddenly a who failed .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic at random .
i am now here on .
the rest 'm going to their imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i just listed . surplus . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week is happening in german .
there 's such a suitcase can be awoken one of them .
afterwards out , the only , <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs that were .
but the people were just , and has a friend told me that from the building forced them .
it was n't told .
and it was that who all at least in the group on , my friend in my friend , i found myself .
god 's too much is n't panic that have , otherwise would be the whole thing that we are not seem harmless way as it .
you see in a crisis , in encroaching disaster is it as a very important .
it 's important because the people at this is literally after telling it <unk> .
they want to know what 's because it .
it used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because called the <unk> and there .
you , so that made by saying , god , people get in panic , say we would n't like the truth or we say the imagery .
this is in a time the social media , a time from twitter , a time of facebook , a time of private and public <unk> , a time , she and public television , it possible .
just and really so , because it 's one is n't have been is and secondly , are doing anyway , the last fragments of agency , over the event report .
remember the may still alive in the passenger in the hudson river , is a year , ago .
the first are about it was at twitter .
of someone who , on a ferry over and was simply and emotional , they kept , here is a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
it was not <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on , today . '' and emotional resilience of the first place the truth to say , and a minor modifications to inform .
because most of course , we 're also the past , supposedly swinging the truth know , because when we do n't we need to of attention to that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , and private media , or not very thought , they do it also not .
of why are what we eat and that 's also something that information , through the media has gone are , we think about how we 're in the future with <unk> deal .
and to do we 're going to the good old raid back out .
but just as a the <unk> .
that means we 're going to the next few years , about a hundred raid , in the <unk> build , and some of you know that still , <unk> , when it 's just to <unk> coming .
it used it was so .
you may be you remember , what 's three briefly , a challenge , and think a means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the world today is increasingly with all <unk> , we 're going to me to do that have , <unk> , from facebook page of twitter , about the radio <unk> also at night , about the tv and after all over the internet and the local media and further and connected course , with <unk> to eventually , in the and more to get .
and we know , we have to there 's very quickly and making modifications to operate and we need to there 's very quickly and making modifications -- up , and empower intellectuals and citizens are n't frightened .
and we ultimately , like , i do n't think this , we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , up the disaster is one of a question of strength of all media , to us are available , and it 's a question of its credibility .
credibility that 's our biggest problem , and empower intellectuals and citizens would say , either , the things in time again true , it 's not , or they say , <unk> us , it 's much worse than it really is .
we have therefore , good about what 's done with facebook and twitter , so long ago .
and that you may have some of in them the media coverage from .
we have a bigger <unk> in food <unk> had .
and that is called a chemical bomb .
this is that strap bombs , with a <unk> has these are , because they are supposed to first , not at the first would be on the <unk> explode , but by their homes in the second world <unk> and just at the ground , because of a chemical response , was going to a little metal plate , the second <unk> two <unk> of each other so that , <unk> , and it on the explosion .
that 's just , many of the suitcase bombs 've never works and it again , in <unk> one of the food <unk> .
and we were from one elderly gentleman , who can be some extent , he , so beautiful in the report was said , easier to , we were now he had seen as you <unk> forty-three good news is and now <unk> he has the authority on informed that 's a bomb . on the
the way since , they have a couple of the older gentlemen reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see what we still find everything .
these suitcase bombs to go right there , to do n't have defused be , but in fact .
and then we have in <unk> park . '' and really a , every sense of the word , a bomb exploding .
and the first time in the history of the city , the whole of talking about facebook and twitter is going to continue with the consequence that the entire <unk> , way <unk> <unk> 've followed .
and the media , they loved . on the water .
we did n't even with are the phone , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
the whole had a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's powered by increased about these social media .
just for that they have to me also an indication if i would do .
i can come from here 's not going to the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because first of these social media the advantage we have that you very much information to pass .
not very <unk> are , because the members that there are or the <unk> , how you might call them , a high <unk> .
secondly , which we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that anyone responded immediately , so that the credibility that , i just talked a clear up , because of the whole community in principle of the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , if anything that 's wrong , it 's very fast as you correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the fun to find , as a bomb on the <unk> park up goes .
of and so , we from all the stuff that the last few years , this that are , and it are much more <unk> happens when some of still think , as some of knows .
also the city of food can see every day of such a home for unlocking .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but you can also cost , and then trace back that we 're now , <unk> be found and then i 'm going to get there with our <unk> and try and the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and when the , think munich , think of other cities , if that then in fact that you need to , because it 's called a <unk> the way to conventional or not community can then we know already be a variety of houses where to do n't know , that look like before .
and that to communicate is important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world her <unk> which is necessary , communication to fix , it 's also going to avoid , to give to worry about to carry that people what are , to have to worry about to carry that people in the are able to come on these difficult situation to .
and the social media to help us as well , because ultimately you all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a one-page <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , here in the <unk> to the big part .
of why is today , fema , not only one task of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross etc. , but about communication in the catastrophe and with a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's over and twitter , facebook a lot of the help the time , if we also partially destroys you still with the kind was , because suddenly <unk> of people have any <unk> build wanted , and did n't even more where the <unk> .
that there 's still much to also for the public in communications <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the around has just showed that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication has n't even more friendly way to think there are .
and i hope i do you a little bit of that convinced that this medium that yes , for the good things of life often is used , in <unk> his sense of purpose and it and that we as a city , for the flight , fema in charge is this instrument came in the future , and then , new , and it worked out to her , to the citizens to use the zones , and citizens and to end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , i do you have the entire time , i 've got .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now , really a <unk> to reasons .
what it is that there i <unk> make sure am that i 'm going to ask them , in a moment ago .
before i do this , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , i believe that we are really to life .
that we have no stories about it could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> there are stories , as of the entertainment business actually be produced .
then i think , that the internet , an infinite amount of , of fact , no <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and fourth , i <unk> convinced that people that were created , to be creative .
and that they have are , the creative be allowed to .
the more people are happy , the better on it 's the world .
very obvious .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , and storyteller .
and the story , i 'm going to tell , starting to midnight poised in a pub , the just happy <unk> singing it .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the can and the singing , not so much with , because the moment , it strikes midnight become is something happens with her .
it 's something your head , in your body , with their perception .
and it has n't really word for .
they do n't know , there 's going on .
i 've all the word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one <unk> and i mean ? in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i see , the feeling that i am somehow find a <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , and then in in oz with very very much color .
and it was at this point , once told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , that i draw .
so the first , <unk> now , their new sensory perception and i can see is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her admission is , you very seriously at and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> enlightens <unk> about in fact that you to a very particular type of people heard .
it was as <unk> born .
are people , from their <unk> have to her lifetime to be .
of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
the <unk> it <unk> n't swords , if you know each meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so small cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is the players have no insight on her as .
we know that , not know , when we die .
i wish , and a long life but we know what 's just not .
it till it already passed .
and therefore , my players , so .
you know what does n't know , what they because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost full minute that kind of the city has been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime think <unk> the moment of <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now , this can of questions : if the because this is dangerous , why games that then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , i 'd want to a around <unk> , everything is gray and only if a player does , he 's actually alive .
the , really are born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you now the world of the players <unk> , first challenges it turns out and of course , but turn in <unk> love , that 's the story , i 'm going to tell .
and it in the form of a <unk> .
the first season has 12 of this excuse me here is a <unk> happens , who i just to postpone , i 've got .
so , 12 of the first season , had a total length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the beautiful <unk> that you know .
that television is for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all would then if only ' i now one is finished .
and not at here .
now is , but , we 're off .
go in mind , to <unk> back .
what 's the most set of the film , or from the series ?
it can only one right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have .
and that 's true of my players , which is not true .
of it 's all kinds of giving .
there 's so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and on and so .
and just <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and therefore be here 's a lot of stories , all be told us want .
now would be the next question : who is this because it all share ?
i ' a fairly huge amount of opinion of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and the most creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , producing as one , it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of itself .
what would be if we <unk> not just nonsense about or give free , but <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much of this <unk> with which is .
for example , in the result was three diving into a <unk> on , you know , class because he 's an example , her grandfather of .
and you 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now with the modern technology is that yes n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , then right , and it 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience down this is .
that means that it 's not anywhere , , but it ends up the right there , where it ends up to go .
this really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet can be honest , really do anything .
so every medium is kind of the light .
that means you a viewer leaves you can write , drawing , turn , om , you want to .
and so if we also again this structure through .
this looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , in which is .
and so i <unk> convinced that the internet was born , it 's those kinds of stories to tell .
it do , unfortunately , not many more specifically at : no one .
so now saying , i but even still a step further and i leave the audience was have to the players .
because in a <unk> .
there can fly against the characters of the series ours , against people in the real specific environment , as these <unk> on your phone .
phrases , this , you are also all very well , something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful giant screen areas , just very rapidly developing .
and in i 'm not just because i do over again two minutes would need .
we believe , together .
everybody 's time it 's comprised of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of , right now i have to the very quickly see this : the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the business .
and i have to say , these grand jury was all of legislators of licit banks , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good thing to my .
and when i 'm going to convince anybody here with my : the world really use that settlement narrative structures revolutionize the way , better world , i believe i can actually every convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is the whole , then , this ?
because it alone in the names all areas i covered .
we 've obviously in the first <unk> , who is that there , i grew up , you 've come up , everybody 's time .
and then that die .
, is very much , died .
everybody 's time it means : everyone needs to time to die .
and then , they also , everybody 's time running in terms of everyone can be part , if it 's going to .
this is i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse , i think , when it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you 've seen that .
if you in the theater , and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all : oh god , please now not me .
and that 's not what it 's .
so it 's volunteer at .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i took german , speak language is that the entire project , of german , it 's why do n't .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way and i 've been tried and wondered : go all the but in english , very important to bigger , blah blah .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
it 's so it 's , that would we in some small niche move .
and i really believe that really , when it 's also other people that 's like me that the people will be grateful to something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the bottom and then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been reclassified .
if that everything that 's , it as i 'd like then goes into the first a result now on the first keeping <unk> online .
and if you now why i 'm here in a <unk> , but under the headline <unk> worth <unk> it .
and i also a couple of done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite heavily dependent on of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .

but it uses yes , it 's nothing if you as it gets .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken out what i learned to have .
and it applied to have .
and yet it 's good .
i can really just say .
so if now somebody you 're going , i want to have been my bit contribute , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i ' a characterization <unk> cartoon or whatever it 's also have already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
well , how positive , the speakers about .
i love ' i also .
welcome to can memories , do ?
question to you .
can memories , do ?
you can , because of all remember , in your life ever happen is ?
they 've still <unk> that ?
who has who can , all remind ourselves ?
it 's no hands up .
so you 're living memory , do ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want it to us today do n't do .
then would be the talk today probably fairly quickly .
let 's good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , i 've chosen , because he 's two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i ' , this around the computer studied and i , let me just with the bits and bytes of busy , today , so large prints through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and do in private and professional capacity in the way .
on the one i so with the `` well , very much too , on the other , i 'm now it in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , and how does that one that the human beings ?
how can because that change ?
the one of these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> intelligence .
so the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we 've been fairly close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but let me tell you time of freedom , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the comparison directly between the computer on the one and our brain on the other .
if we the computer taking off , it 's based out , everything , your smart , you a tablet , you <unk> and these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators , <unk> little chip .

those parts are all of introduce a transistor .
the word has certainly been each of and <unk> it , as a triangle of the arts .
this <unk> little device that has three to add and forth , electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , it , i see , the extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of little parts .
and the gears on there in a mess .
we store the things , we we do things , we have degrees ' you with albert einstein said , listen to shoot 'n computer can do anything you can be very much , very quickly , but he can just zero and one of compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite disturbed me .
we want it 's compare with our brains .
our brain has the smallest unit of the neuron , neuron , and we 've also because i <unk> , a hundred billion , a hundred billion neurons are in our of gray up here in .
this beautiful but is our our neurons have not only three of connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because there 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 , 14 zeroes after i 'll end .
so , because you see already the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , now what we 're still a computer .
we want to the <unk> time for contrast , maybe the bottom , or other possibilities about the , the first background -- that had their own power station on up , that were , and the its the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> , , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is and this is , the equivalent of two of bananas , more you do n't and you to turn it 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> the things that good part up here , <unk> the things on computers with <unk> , why we use the then not , why that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet in that the human nature uses only 10 percent of his brain , buy it now this <unk> to <unk> brain .
and <unk> 's wrong , the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , yes , perhaps , but our brain is yes , over our evolution lobby , capable of pups , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle there 's still our <unk> with in all other , <unk> educated .
this is not be to happen because we do n't use .
why it seems then that we the largest piece of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of the unconscious list ?
the i compared ' depths of , beautiful with the iceberg , if you do the iceberg see , in the sea , is the top so the top , and then there 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that this is that 's what we make it , our thinking mind is , you 'll walk , nine-tenths 's a giant <unk> ne square .
we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and to time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , and suddenly , much more detail it can remember when i do n't seen have , in the situation ne , and tell and then <unk> it , i ' said yes , but already , but , where you know that ?
this is about there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , someone with <unk> , somebody , mostly in a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , who has a so good <unk> memory , which is a plane , on , a plane , a medevac helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome effectively went , rome in it so rome is yes now : ow , not necessarily the city , after a gigantic signs of chips on and has started , rome to draw .
and that 's not a way , so here that flow , and there is , that no every home , every single door , and every window , he once seen it , he <unk> , he could be back to paper into .
where is now that ?
so why can say the , why we ca n't do that now that he 's also be a very close to the <unk> bit more access , nine-tenths of underneath .
now we use the yes , , but why i can now not going to the moment to <unk> last night remember , and the details of ?
'n friend <unk> of me has to make an interesting about what 's done .
he has even for example , you 've been working , and with a rape survivor who worked , i 've talked to experience is completely eliminated that was n't even more mind that <unk> <unk> the brain , it did n't happen , that 's gone .
right , with that came the very good right .
now about but about the people <unk> .
there 's what you a very safe session , the end or after this event back to , even be no more active -- remember this was , she was then the hallmark of the car see , of these people <unk> that was not <unk> that was under its feet on .
and actually is with the hallmark of the big on doing it was .
the second what i think it 's found it 's got a lady in <unk> had , has told that your mother donates her , alice in wonderland read it as they 're small was , so four years .
there was driving them on the which your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he has she said , trance , pushing there , ago .
then she have begun to read , it was four days when they have that is they could then , do n't read , now , it .
and they said , he 's actually tell me , <unk> .
they actually have a specimen from alice in wonderland found , right on this side of the text which said , the lady read .
the brain has so this page as it was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we 've actually retained access it , but we seem like , there in the normal life . say <unk> of <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
now , that we know , not the event , per day , but how <unk> have said , it 's a an image , seen , a a <unk> , we put it turns out , rather with our sense , that , we see that , we will get that , we hear that , we taste and that , we feel , hey , when you <unk> , a yellow lemon thinking and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you <unk> sense , like the taste , quite an example .
and , it was now <unk> long last night , you put them , <unk> are going to , , <unk> bit above and , can i ask you , and yet , they just a very quickly affects your eyes .
and , remember a welcomed discomfort , one incident in the recent past , yes .
they take the first , coming .
and , if you do now , you might notice that you to this memory for a visual part .
they get maybe a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some of the time not only on , because there 's so normally do , but they do this the first time that .
and if you see that , it be that you , either in the movie revenues are , from their eyes all experience , like , you see on a canvas .
this one that we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they have to the idea to solve , to the eyes peering back up .
who 's because a visual information , anyway , let 's hand up ?
yeah , go , <unk> ' a few hands up , this is to shoot 'n third , i 'd say , this is that 's what i expect it 's it 's actually a little , we so often do that it 's the first moment not nice thing .
well , just do <unk> on .
<unk> , is beautiful , of memories , if you have memories <unk> , yes , not only that memory <unk> <unk> feel we <unk> a positive event and i said , the one or another one smile can see , there was so that was beautiful , there was , you laugh , and it 's the memory may still in fact that we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was that , well , our brain power of the spot , no difference between what we actually remember , and the , we just imagine , we could color .
and that you can try out , if you home , and <unk> down and to the future , imagine that 's still not happening is they are similar information into how do something , if you to take something remember , in the past .
and a you know , which are these stories , you , so here in social round , of time .
then , hey , because this happen and that , and this was so beautiful , and the longer these stories behind it , the beautiful photographs , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , a lot of social situation , there was the sunset it , a lot more romantic , there was the waterfall , much higher .
if we could that the experience it do , if we really our memories that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask you ?
<unk> , when i came down here , my uncle buys a picture that , of his hut in switzerland .
a picture it 's also a very beautiful hut .
it , the image is , <unk> bit more than the shack , it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he told me , well there is the shack <unk> bit around , there is , 'n bit more of grass there 's a beautiful dog because which is the sun shining on the alps , this is quite an image of the shack , not to raise .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , it bothers me , because if i think that still more fun doing , what i there is think ?
they 've actually make a freedom in their own thoughts .
<unk> you are so yes some people , that you see the morning , if you just like this gray matter have eyes , is because this ?
yes , that , let 's slept together , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me , i wo n't go .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he died , germany was , because his mother in hong kong was left , and he did you just awful missed .
what the father 's done , he , every night with the son down and has said , has been asking , so what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , tell and then he has been able to tell let it <unk> let it just tell let me , today with , happened .
and , within two weeks ago about the son is doing fine .
and then it was also okay , that -- is farther away , coming again , to visit .
and the is now the that , all the youth of done with the place , which is one of the <unk> people , i know .
it so these are not the memories , we are , the , how we 're going , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we rely on the waste them or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that was today now : ow , this is the ne square that practice , but i really not , they make it 's there , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> into the film he has this , that these <unk> computers where he files <unk> <unk> , do it 's also for you picture that <unk> have of as well , well , not so you have a have to tell you , yeah well , <unk> now <unk> happened , but to whack , way that .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , beautiful , you look over time <unk> , yes , and that i <unk> ' real , man that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take this , mate with .
they take this with in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if they <unk> 'm going to actually ne , whether it 's <unk> their their boss , or your spouse , or her husband , <unk> , they laugh <unk> .
so , so again , this picture they sit <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let the horses jump , you laugh , why they laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these thoughts are funny .
and you can be much better with the situation all around .
ca man memories so , do ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity , that it 's all that can .
it does but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important to an event , a memory , one of them , it depends on us .
my plea to you end , they play with the images into your head , they use the power of their own unconscious and they give him every day <unk> , their lives in the process .
yes good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i was a party , asks me , what i in my spare time doing and telling me to come together with friends a <unk> get organized and make them , i have the shining eyes and the mind my audience around the connotation of those dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
and when i <unk> that it , in this to a film festival , classical music is , we say , of those dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of going to sit and very focused on the art listening .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is how about architecture to dance .
and it 's very much more importantly , that with the what we do .
so they still , a glimpse of getting what i 'll talk , i have you a film with them .
a film .
there is something ' <unk> it .
that 's my view , in the place on the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out something completely different .
we makers are today , so forth between eighteen , prosperous middle , the two decades old and have very early in our youth who experienced that receive an enormous power and delight us that classical music <unk> .
and we , but also seen that the conventions of <unk> and the <unk> us there some people come as well , what can .
and we are the something that belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not the content , the music , but at their <unk> .
so we think about the question , how can we have a <unk> create the music the near , friends and that power back there , of the we pay so , you 'd like .
how can we have a <unk> organize that infects the conventions of <unk> work ?
we put the parameter , you from the classical concert of space , time light , context , basically in question .
, for example in the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually photographing there 's between the stage and the audience a gulf .
we 're trying to the up .
you see it 's a picture of our <unk> .
the musician is sitting in the audience , drink beer , entertain , breaks down with the audience , standing on , are two pieces , so , again in the audience .
this is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody knows , like it has <unk> , comes in stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in classic concert , it 's having to think , comfortable , integral to chairs , like you here , and forward , look and listening .
but there 's music , you can not actually sit still .
and we 've thought , and how can this will .
if you sit and finally , to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , they 're going to use a way to .
still socialized to come to the concert does n't a stage had , but four stages of the audience around .
the audience could mean time , <unk> .
so there sitting on the night every once in the front row .
to us is that we 're not just any events are doing , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we 're so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the mind of the people need the music that it should be to be known as you do to ?
and then performing at the morning at <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , s 's actually just of <unk> lit be , clubs , <unk> , old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around it and the illumination can make music is going to let and now , but the connection with other arts .
and we are totally happy that we 've been a few years with the <unk> work together , with us ; or movement to music to <unk> that really did n't want to dance has been written .
and then they <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve get rich .
and this year we 've got a , if you can be so , <unk> too .
we have the first time a concert and with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story of soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has all , and therefore it 's because we have a big <unk> had , us in this piece by accident .
we have about a <unk> much money from people , go back , so that we into could .
there is this film festival is something , from a community figured out of life .
we 're totally happy , proximity of <unk> in the town <unk> a home found .
the city is just big that we have great physical spaces and exciting place for performing at finding , but that , that we 'll notice .
if the year in the spring of two weeks for <unk> from europe , in the city are , then drops on just that in the city more people with <unk> around , usually .
that all about this is volunteering that organized .
we makers are a very colorful characters of my students and students , doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or did and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year for a compulsory tasks are picking .
it now , volunteering , but they do for a year that for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , <unk> in of hands are and to this is organized .
we do that would all of leisure and in , germany .
that means that the worst part of the work of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , we make us about this year distributed to a city weekend , we make , they repeat the bottom , or other problems , appeared soon are , and caring for this is also interpersonal each other problems that 's just get hugely important is , you that 's moving , keep going to .
for this even come then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers first responders , for a few days or a few weeks of their hands of being and there is where food aid 's needed to the <unk> that , the <unk> that , the <unk> that , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the way to .
now you could snot my office to do we have all you for a this needs .
but our <unk> is that .
we have is in <unk> in the city a large community to us built around , well , supported in the what we want to make .
this is the classic <unk> this is , but also about very practical things like , for example , for , we have a wholegrain baker , the us to bread <unk> or a <unk> that 's fresh food to figure out there .
this <unk> is in a noble , in the city and the whole year and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> the whole series of individuals and the us their living room to put to a musician and samples .
and on this way of this is this typeface to enable them in this city and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very particular way of with that this .
since the year , we were able to thank <unk> of support the citizens got there , a <unk> to live out , now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers of the stage , believe that classical music , i 'm say'n , provided it comes in the right hands .
so we are incredibly deeply happy about that in europe , young musicians played music in your hand , you take home in fact , the cities <unk> hold .
so , when they now , still not really can imagine , it feels , classical music , so to experience then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> , and we would be delighted , if you actually , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you just think that 's favor .
know what you need to try to learn or the effect of learning , but i mean to learn about rd2d2 , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
that 's unbelievable experience of time <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i made of art and culture learned when i 'm now that i can be a lot of course , because now ar owned by <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought that maybe it really would be that something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give me , my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , but much work .
they 've now , both laughed .
you get better and the laughter , though most of the saying know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word because it 's something <unk> , we 're not really means we can .
art , say that we also that 's what .
to work . say that 's that 's what .
sometimes it .
the people like to work that 's what to me .
but at work we think more likely to the <unk> and in the art , at the realm beyond the chaotic everyday , where we look inside move our experience , trying to our own thoughts that .
and i mean change , who i you now you want to about three hours in five into a split , all the have , and he starts with it for you very simple .

the interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
some of them is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian leave you know .
<unk> that two- and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , you pass reasonably puts up , and i -- we practiced .
and so 10 , 11 , i 've got these little pieces and she said , on the piano , not far from here at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there is a melody and ground and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in art that it succeeds , and if it 's only two who are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , what 's sometimes , works , images , <unk> to see , things that <unk> are now , in the moment to put together , that gives art .
and i and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes three , in the <unk> <unk> , both being able to play , every one of , but to hear , a horrible wishes , did n't .
that was , naturally , i learned , among other .
okay , another experience i never forget and i was the worry about it to me today may also like to be .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and the <unk> i came out .
i did it .
i brought her .
so again at the started r and the same point i knew it , not on .
the audience has more and sweated , when i , because i went in all quiet on my place , brought my notes , i put them , and he started the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think , like that i <unk> 've got behind .
but this was having a very immersive experience .
perhaps that was also one of the experiences , and then i knew well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> i should n't perhaps i spent go here , because that can be easier with cheating .
the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , overridden by , inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , let me sir <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver that 's not .
it 's nothing to you all kinds of coffee houses to have and very much experience with women raised .
now imagine , imagine a <unk> young man , young , as a sentence .
the i kind of course not forget .
and , but i kind of course , more adept at .
now i was actually , and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember a situation , i 'm like never more experienced that i .
it was that <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i get to the part of work , i have a place to just do n't control , and it was with the most beautiful place , as you had the poor and then went this together again , and back apart .
i could it now unfortunately , not going to play , is not a piano here , and i could it .
i have this job in two decades , 30 times a row on and suddenly got them right .
and then i did you keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and she said , and i know , that i suddenly on the cushions off and laughing .
i was , except me .
and i did n't finish , not taken , and the music has this , i did .
an experience where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also really , to work that you that had you get , this condition , i call it 's the <unk> .
where all of yourself going .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like of myself as we the <unk> did , the only two months taken , where you usually a half years to need to fall .
now , this was my unsighted experience with the piano , with art , whole bunch of work .

i was first one more than a musician is the way , but just as <unk> .
we 've got into playing , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given and i got there are so you wanted to my <unk> for the music and re-engage them can and that <unk> had .
in the singing , all breathe , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience , i really , and infused into .

because the art of culture to bear , to my <unk> .
so this work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would be honest , not say <unk> , but as <unk> basically , and you do things .
i was there in the theater and i <unk> , there 's in germany , not a program for <unk> , just in vienna , and i did , and , but i 'm going to , with this question about me , we can do to art to the framework for art to improve access to , a management , a good design features of building ?
and that was the reason why i then also on 'm in my professional lives , towards this <unk> , and <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but it was a different <unk> , and this phase i mean , overridden by , interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because what i <unk> was even born , it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> to pet peeves i am i have to this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
this was i 'd rather make something , i 'm not the time and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , a <unk> , a culture , lived there was a lot of people in this in bureaucratic device the <unk> .
once the carnivale on us was approaching , were all in a very different situation , very different states .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , then we have always for the <unk> the music and he i piano , other has a bass played an example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done so , but of course , with text of <unk> <unk> , for months working with him .
and this carnivale . that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny to the ninth of november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , the wall is , yeah .
i quickly , on being prepared to get any questions , <unk> .
and around , because i was <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and i 've got back through the interaction as it be happening between two germans cultures .
actually talk to the same language , music is there , wonderful and was wonderful and she said , but a lot was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale it was n't have of the people all within ourselves but it was a lot of it up , and i put this as a beautiful addition realizing , here to experience as the german as well that i get after time , back , track of them , and the german <unk> then these two states is bringing them .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also on the federal much more <unk> placed .
so i then , all things here we learned and experienced , the city of food .
we have the first place that i had actually a <unk> , so now , the time ago , when i here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i 've got the still .
time for was <unk> that did n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first board of <unk> .
so i play , not much so anyway , that was wonderful to deliver those <unk> but she disappeared , because i then for education in charge , and went to make alliances with the education do and they could .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the what if it 's this simple analog between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what 's where we had to have repercussions , <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture of the <unk> to <unk> of the blue one of stones .
many of interactions , we could and i could make and i experienced , and hopefully incorporating them , that means if different people from different areas , a target to track .
they memorize the way that i 'm going to , <unk> of the art , the culture , we do is , let 's unifying between humans between cultures , between those communities , i said , the view , and i come but afterwards , in art .
interaction , she was then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , would be , january <unk> that <unk> could the <unk> europe for .
but that last chapter that is a fifth one chapter one has yet the positive identification .
this word has yes , agreed-upon meanings , firstly , i either pushed me with something , <unk> so i started to something , and i could it , as verb use and i either something that is , i know something .
and that is always in his quirks .
i know something with his quirks , why i say , i either you , or that community .
and i either pushed me with something , when i 'm going to <unk> and that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a big action .
five had three million people to try to move <unk> cities , to identify the double that sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we 've been doing it <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , in a big imagine your life and yet , at a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here , and was our key frontier , positive identification , to the other people and of them , they also a ride .
in the signs of <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> i have not many people around .
there ham 's <unk> <unk> and two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and young students from a speak at school , from <unk> <unk> , letters of young men , from <unk> to play the data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter that have written .
and it was already a special effect that young girl letters of young <unk> up and the russians and using letters of young men from germany in a visibly broken german .
and sat down , one of these young men in the piano , and this <unk> , who i so loved .
and , oh , who he made from a letter , and said , i 'm a pianist , he wrote him at home , as young german , he played , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger down with a <unk> , sat down , back to the piano in that play on <unk> carl , and the <unk> to play .
and it did n't displace it .
it was for me as a touching the scene , that i 'm going forward , jump i said , we 've actually learn ?
we 've learned , the <unk> that many people together something can move , but all things we 've learned that we sixties years in through central in peace life and the culture of us that comes together , that we 're not working , the minds go , because we have different languages to talk , that we are blessed to identify ourselves to us inside of feeling .
and it was for me a wonderful experience and you see it goes to learn not just about to know .
it goes to learn , about something to learn and <unk> .
and if we have a lot to create and this happen , <unk> , if we tolerate that we inspire us let 's kind of art and culture , our own right position to , dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally done , our own identity , and work by we 're thinking about art and culture in a let me , we all have won
and i hope they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they those profit .
thank you .
thank you .
i think we wait on the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to the support my memory is that 's a few slides <unk> .
it are but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here about one direction to find and me with a theme through , where i think that 's going to the next few years much about .
through <unk> words i know now finally , thank you for me , ted 's also means , and i believe in <unk> we can this talk about on .
and then , i had heard that you the talk about in english think if somehow became possible , but , if you look at it you see it would n't understand what i in english to say , i was not directly , it as i should tell and so i the talk , but in german , left .
how we will die .
i have to them there first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , i the <unk> <unk> , and bringing down .
it was built , nine-tenths of years old , and he would always in the may to dance , because it 's also , their wives who remembered that tries to the first man that in war like this was then .
and it 's of every year for the first of may to dance has left and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> much to finish , and then is bringing down and , it , here to the right , you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years before it was also , bringing down and had the same way , with equal occasion , information , the left leg gets broken .
and i was also been there as a physician and i experienced , for weeks was in the intensive , and you start with the antibiotics was treated , resurrects itself was , and i have the discussion around , has been said , is because that sense ?
it makes no sense , in a so old people like this intense in fact is to use to face ?
so order to <unk> , in the intensive care for weeks , that is a people at <unk> ?
and it 's and cured .
five years later , the clinic , see the name <unk> , and i can all know , because he just so rare is also for the time in fact , and has the dance in the may be back that one leg gets broken .
so the question is what <unk> , i actually , when i talk about , like a human , to decide to , what he shares his directives , or he also , <unk> which ?
and this is a little bit of the theme of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to , a report on the <unk>
and then it was that the amount of globalization are very ahead was that , so , you ask how it because go , connected to work ?
this , then , and it in this book now , read , just said , it becomes a quality and so that the parts always fit .
it becomes a power -- the work in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going to , like to china , this was a big issue .
and that 's also that come to basically the work of the individual , to assemble , something to paint off , one are seen was that he always be controlled by , to quality , he piece , of the accuracy .
and that , my prior assessment , people 's uncles and fewer and confidence from their work to could and more and part of a little <unk> were , when you about , as height of <unk> to do , not more about that through his work , to define .
and if we do this now being on the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's obviously just an evolution .
if you in television 's hear , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most not find yourself , there is it the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when it 's nothing to document to me , you 've done with it <unk> is so it does it 's going , and if not going to document is , collectively , the health service 's also , that care or this is medical treatment for we do n't .
and through this feature documentary , but the work <unk> always be <unk> and going to , is approaching this idea that you his work too and use of personal belief compound , the background , as a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , from holland , because he showed this , i wo n't want to , who had a <unk> practice , the up and is , from holland , at the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are at these development comes mostly a piece of forward and he knows , martin , had just experienced , that , old people swing between the home , the hospital , there and back , because the <unk> , i wo n't know , they should do , when it 's the people got to .
and then , the the hospital , we 'll have restored to go back in my home , nor home , and be there on those loans .
and this family had , just thought , when it 's something perfectly structured them in holland , there , i want to me there 'd like train let me , to here to promote that you go out of this vicious cycle of the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> .
there now , in holland 've had he but these brain , after he the language with a lot of that they 've had learned that there , the same thing happens , in this <unk> happened .
it will also the dying is a quality of .
it , it is the credibility that counts , but you put even in a very well , there , i example , not be , or not the hospital , if i in the home .
and then that will be honored .
in holland , it 's , third of days find a conversation with the newly admitted that we think , and they have to then , an issue , i the hospital or i do n't know , the hospital , when i do something happens .
just with the , i want to be or i do n't be .
this data to know , on a central and there is that doctor for <unk> , has always the on , and then the decision in the basis .
if we now , <unk> back , yes like in the may to dance has , and even slowing down was , and we imagine , have looked at an advance directives written , not to be , there would have you these subjects , dance in may be in the may , where they then back down is , , not anymore to experience .
and this for my friend , there in the netherlands is , also very much <unk> , he , with us to go .
in the past it 's so that <unk> is about their sixties , seventy percent of the people , it home , and die , but in hospitals , that institutions , and that these institutions that we also , so can this , it 's not the ideals of habitats these are for an old people , but it 's often a tightly to fund closely <unk> scope of the <unk> are often <unk> and the federal funding and of , this <unk> find there , and my own perception , just limited .
there 's quite homes , the very good about , there 's very <unk> people , there , in fact , but when i think about the <unk> at it , and we 've got about <unk> patients in the year , so roughly five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us so , are , i would for me say , it is difficult , there cope and be a sense to hold .
the entire course , <unk> reasons that 's clearly , this whole quality , this kind of it 's in place , because in the last of the money not enough , that all people powerful optimal , and under way of those are and that the people that need to deliver or the medical performances that paid to realize that they say , there was -- i well , because i can look for a nurse a family of feed with one or two children .
this is simply not the reality , but you need two salaries , <unk> and <unk> and most of it actually , just below .
this introduction of the quality as a time is a market , the way to regulate , want to make it , so , of the individual countries affected .
and now , how to the maybe we can escape , you do we now in the past , because i mean , first of questions asked , and this , so , it 's the situation for affected .
and i 've just time that <unk> <unk> and the articles , been told me there <unk> , because i think , a society which needs , structures that , the legal structure , which we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just said , dignity of people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is it works to 's top of task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes did n't there , is still a third set in there is , because every one , too , the commission , he was going to protect and to defend themselves .
because it a way is , singing to free from this case , i give it 's another way and to me time somehow , and , and feed and then i need to me at least not thinking about how i because even die .
because in the past it is yes , so , even though we do this subject does n't like to ask , we wo n't some of the point is coming .
hopefully will first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say that i hope for any gap , and i want , too worried , but eventually you going to the subject to ask , and if it then maybe as far is it could just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is it already late in life to be late in life be able to say , i about this question now , what i think .
now if you think about to do i 'd fainted from , they 're going on the points where in the last out , we are because actually the five of things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , quite en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , i , where i go and exchange can , i know and the me through the life with me , it are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , where i may also related to have , <unk> or in the actual visits in or a pastor or a <unk> or just inspecting other people , where to having to note .
and it there are all kinds of one of course , there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .

and then come then , another factor that we 've been a dictatorship suppressing the <unk> experience . i got this time as a text typed or as well , as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be up of us even come out .
so it 's not the question to be because others to me to do , who 's going to me , power , for babies , or , for me in fact , who are going to me ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to be asking where i can on people , want , where i can bring and by my inner would be able to come with these questions that can and i was there position and make it .
and then when you know how we 're going to , that inside this quality of us from put it was , it 's a way to say , how i me about my my inner that this mechanism to escape .
because no man can tell me at random , i have , because see and position to .
and i have to be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or that 's out , you have to now an advance directives out and because you 've been so old ; you exactly , whether you can be would see if you on a neonatal intensive want .
these questions , i can in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> left .
this was the people 's one of posture , in me is and the not from that we can be , the state is not protecting can also a law not , and that i 'm also other people <unk> to me and more <unk> be , if i just there myself before trying to myself , so that the also know what i for a person who am .
and to those conversations have to live , it 's spaces , and i think , and so i have this talk so called , and here , i think , are these spaces like this <unk> in that i showed you here two to go on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we 're over these subjects to think where a more room is so it does n't hurt this is that it may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation there is happening .
so we , if we call the old are , you wanted to say , oh , as a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would still a .
i thank you very much for listening .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to flat is just keep them , a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yes !
it 's not good , if this one of this is the what 's looking .
so , in fact , but what 's the it for the , you know it .
that 's what we do n't .
we engage us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little bit from the finite planet .
ne , finite we know , which are specifically , we need to know .
and it goes to the <unk> of magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite the way are , and those two <unk> , the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know already now , we look in the box in the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in lots of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means we would just the people <unk> one , two three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite , it 's also at large numbers , although it sucks .
but it does .
how do you still lost count ?
how can still be checking , that many people like the chairs are there ?
i realized : chairs and people and not what else .
<unk> let me !
that 's called the couples .
you very well , that 's not , we 're now the ground up in the , and understand that 's also all .
not that 's very nice .
so it 's called , too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> away , the next <unk> , everything is use , different people get different musical chairs , not a chair is abandoned and the amount of these are the same height , okay ?
now we 're going to the infinity .
how can we have two large infinite amount of each giving it ?
we would say , one is large or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would be back to .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you an infinite speed for a lot start to count , i 'd let 's just say , they are not to another .
ne , infinitely , is actually ne square ?
so how 's ?
madame ?
no way , `` madame .
they had that 's just really started .
there !
so now , we 're looking at the time .
estimate . appreciate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you know , you know , no end , yeah ?
the point of this is that makes it very simple .
if i said , for the <unk> take , those numbers , actually ne , we scientist who need the next to the beginning , zero , one two , three , four , five .
and we have , say , a piece of this <unk> and take from that xeroxed piece of the infinitely you <unk> pay off .
there are the just numbers , okay , zero , two four ne square ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of long , the natural numbers , but on the a band n't have the <unk> , on the others are the straight and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot , g , straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n , the natural numbers .
do you know ?
is hit g , powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same or smaller ?
the same ?
now , this is done , yes , the one is n't know , the <unk> .
who have a different what you do ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , has yes really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yeah , not be yes ?
you can be honest , not , where do n't there , bigger , that 's not going to actually ne square ?
okay , you 're smaller ?
would assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you also suspected that is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm explaining why the amount of the same .
and how does it ?
right .
we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next the ground zero , plus two is two , after the zero , one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , two , six , three , eight , four , yeah ?
you can it also turn , they do it doubled , it 's going to actually ne square ?
and completely clear that is through <unk> we do it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on and the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural in line , <unk> , <unk> are way and the band is still in a long .
just in an infinite .
so if you some explain , we have today we learned , infinity , coupled with what 's because gone forever , i 've just finally ?
one of infinity has a property , there 's in a finite because it 's not and this is , is absolute <unk> , a real subset , just large is .
that they can do in a finite n't know , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a gap , and that were about three .
so we 've infinity done .
is there has fallen asleep ?
okay .
then do we still a second part of probability .
the professionals , meeting -- odds .
i did this is what brought .
with this experiment i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know and <unk> it does anybody with that on yeah ?
so we call the doors , a b , .
i think there something hidden , i hope they have it 's not heard .
and they should now why do n't guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a b , or c ?
guess , here in our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who has , another idea ?
a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to actually ne , b has been missing , not , you hear the yes never been on the ne square ?
this is right .
it 's completely ignorant about , they have to do n't mean , three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , because , the chance that you , they have been blessed , is : yeah it has only in a third .
ne , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , the world , here actually ne square .
so i know where it 's because it was , and guess , and appreciate that , journaling , you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm actually now the game of what i now , now , <unk> .
it is so we go in a second round .
now i <unk> me on the a ne square ?
so now i have to a door to show , behind the n't it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if they 're going to b , and i say , and i know , it is yes , instead of b .
then there 's no regular customers , second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , of luck .
but i have to this is econ 101 , the second round go .
so i can just an open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the meeting -- probability , the sisyphus condition 's remained , the sisyphus condition that it be open is , and it is , you 've now your last chance , it was going to guess .
they must now in a to stay , i 'm not necessarily a , on .
now , i will grow the , they want .
or they say , i 'll be c on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become evolvable ?
phew , very nice , b is on , and so i know , it 's behind c .
or but , god 's thanks to b has opened up again , is , i always wanted to a to stay it does .
or do you now say , there 's <unk> , we have the ne , way that , we 've only still two doors , now it 's get to change or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why it 's <unk> ?
yes , that 's wrong .
this seems that , almost like , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have the ne square ?
but that are you actually ne , are a new no fun .
so here , it 's very <unk> , yes .
that get all sorts between , i do n't know , six and , i ca n't sixties , you can i 'll do n't even more coming up , actually ne square ?
so it get really everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just going to a third of a door .
you can guess , you want you have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
that means that would you can on two doors to guess it , it is yes , in <unk> do you can yes , two dozen that , it actually ne , if you have the zero , let 's still , yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so now is this , two thirds of it 's not , you guess .
so what 's the two thirds of here , but it 's just behind a door of manufacturing processes .
the back here is that 's not .
so , what is likely ?
, we do , that 's really interested in .
now , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
well , one of course .
so that was now not hard to actually ne square ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have of luck .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope it was for everybody what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here is one of this is no diet and bad food and their overweight people are reported this depressed , yes completely .
but i started , my best thing that after all the way is that some insights .
i come , because of <unk> farm and knew i got to 12 was actually not a mcdonald 's .
this before , for others , right .
yeah .
thank you for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know that this gentleman <unk> , so i 've got to me to be asking whether i did the ted in the lake up to try and over a particular topic to talk .
i blew me <unk> <unk> : the subject of trust .
their motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , , once said , maybe it makes the bottom , or other afterwards , sports .
if only i also full of this .
so tonight is the rain , jogging to be now <unk> too damn hard , i 've got to make tomorrow , actually train , because to three weeks on the <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to want to 'm bicycle tube -- that are <unk> a half .
so i 've left with the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so who have a ride , want to <unk> , go tomorrow early on , <unk> , i post , they all welcome a .
i see , the degrees , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i said , starting to do , based on <unk> .
do n't worry , the beauty , it essentially , the blind faith to come up afterwards <unk> .
i see , before me just thought about it done when i <unk> 'm going to describe to the place where i <unk> ?
so i come from 'm village with six ] houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents lying on the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> , beer .
trust , sports , of course not in <unk> but for me , <unk> and beer .
why i 'm doing , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really right down from , from the village get , and there was raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and the brother , the same for it 's like me .
i mean , which is visible light and dark , who can see how i 'll also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it all the light , or it 's like .
what is very convenient is for the switching layouts .
the , we both can you see if of us anything .
'n street , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> goalposts .
of the theme of the old men ne square .
and to go into .
and what to me , but always show it was critical , is one of course , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> the thing i time .
and that was for my parents definitely is that it 's how many of them , before my brother and i still do n't even blind people knew .
we were the first , then is a sudden in their lives <unk> .
and then they had scavenged from the situation of what do .
and now , love i , it 's a giant sees that my parents than 185 farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and us to , the to move or to say , there 's actually ne wall , <unk> you know , along and can then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we have been home so <unk> .
and b , ham our parents stay alive in the us to them , where we want to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , home alone <unk> , stairs up and <unk> , it 's risk .
there 's the blind brother , then i really , i 'm <unk> <unk> would just pushed <unk> used in .
the order to the order to i have to today still .
this is with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , for the <unk> .
and our , brothers and my brothers and i think we ham , i 'm what 's really all troubles outside did n't , ma , you could do , especially for example , drive .
and that has the people who are brother and excitement started with three years and then we wanted , they also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to drive , in many small children are today , running wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have this , starting with <unk> , no .
and then the big question is : how to be an ma , there ?
and how do you get the confidence , one that trust the parents that the children , eventually brought back from a bike fall down and <unk> and the other faith of us that we 're not permanently where it go .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us , let 's where are the <unk> , where is a car , where <unk> followers , may also a very unfamiliar things , sure enough homes -- that you put it now it away -- because we know , so they are .
and we had to get in choosing , let 's one even know , but that will also hear .
and that you can now in here , unfortunately , not all the test , because you will it 's as loud , that they do n't actually more of them .
but <unk> , the evening when you so what it 's light switch off and , their bedrooms , whose bedrooms and then they orient to .
can take a try to just <unk> associate with the tongue , to orient and you 'll notice that 's at us humans as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance .
so how the bats , so <unk> will also you hear from , <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , you trust , in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> as high backup to have , and the safety , i see , the ne chance to me because <unk> piece of helping .
and i just to orient no big trouble and yes , many accidents , , there 's course , eh .
what i 'm here today is no pictures , i ' that i 'm very <unk> itself is one of our <unk> also as children .
because the climb on our higher state building on 'm half the farm .
i see , here 's written , the confidence is also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my darlin ' i 've been very literally , because when i person , much better , and later in <unk> and the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side of busy and i 'd ' , i 'm talking about one never know , or i never this ecology of how i am i was have seen plenty of have .
i ' depths of it 's never leave you may also be when we 've read .
now , but this point is also to do with that 's clearly not everybody that 's just as an experience .
diversity is the way of our strengths with the most important to regain some point to know where i 'm going well , i talent and where i can just saw my strengths actually also full <unk> ?
and our brother 's the court , michael and i 've always been picking up on top of the house .
so she said , right , we ham 's a <unk> .
there can from somewhere 'm half thousand windows <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the sebastian and then the tush , michael afterwards and i said , probably already still <unk> slightly the girl playing , you actually ne ne , i 'm not sure .
but the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i 'm not .
and i think , the others , we 're honest , the generation of the young women in here , not .
and of why i know , and yet , with .
and then , it was the consequence that we 're at all three <unk> <unk> up around and the dad , i 'm used to 'm <unk> walked up and i did n't like , i knew , he now , what to say .
because they trust is , then when others doubt .
if the father so , to god , help to help to help them , if only , the risk of relative size been that one of us , too afraid to get have and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would be .
is , but never happened .
he had to then , <unk> that he 's just said , again , slowly <unk> has or by johannes having the us then returned .
and that was , i want to me very great , that we have opportunities .
but you do n't worry that 's no value , not necessary to later <unk> .
for me were the range of sports , in my life , always important were , all , yes , interesting .
and all , they were all this <unk> , because i 'll also could see , where i ' i so my borders , we 're going to be so my endowments .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 'd never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , to do n't like in <unk> .
i go , to get out in rain .
now , not in five degrees in the moment .
and in <unk> rain , but nevertheless , rather than just inside .
but i ' , for me that the confidence in my strengths with found that i kind of sports that i went back .
as the first example , <unk> .
and it was for me very beautiful , because there 's the coach , the us in <unk> , ok , we have , these are kids , send ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
it 's actually about yeah well , because there you pack , anyway becomes the long coats .
and then you realize what the other people power .
and there was , my big trust , of course when i the competition for many of making it 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps there , what do what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and that 's a faith in my fast .

i 'll figure it 's not out .
i did it i thought , actually ne square .
i think , that 's now <unk> bit risky .
and it looks like i also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
ne square .
crap , i <unk> ''
okay .
the next to me that was a sports in school , you , then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are to <unk> and that they have us , whoever taught me as children .
but for me was always in school , wait for it matters : how can i spend as much , and also in school , move to build my excess energy out ?
and i was then a way in school , <unk> .

and ' i used -- love ' i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually said : well , i do with the <unk> .
and i see , then you do the first time , man is the great diversity here in the sport , because you condition , needs , you need power , a good did and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work done ?
so that is it also in <unk> .
you will only then when you that you have confidence in the own humble technology .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also , then , every conditions that , the bad weather , any yield to snow , the <unk> snow , at the size ; they can .
and if you my case you also religious faith in the team .
because when <unk> , nothing like i 'm sure , to <unk> <unk> .
and i there 's still never give hellish freeway on like today -- i have to charge of the use -- my <unk> -- there 's , one -- has now , my exercise was done .
it 's -- but nothing we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> 's going to tell you might just time .
do with a , one of you later , another exercise .
what i is always do the subject and what we trust , that is the exercise to the listener , just imagine making it 's like this is , you do n't see that <unk> to make and fifty <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , you have two sticks in my hand .
of so , i ' i do n't hand anymore else could i mean , my darlin ' <unk> take and the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> the of me , it .
and the told me with the voice of the route .
so the needs to just always have <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication , in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tell me just always <unk> , if it <unk> is about the tell me <unk> and <unk> , that would say , on every 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the old-fashioned technology at with laser pointer .
when he says , on 10 little sharper left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to go back and ask , he has to me back over again , then i know , so , now is what does n't .
and to me is yes , the very large , critical , when the <unk> of me , there 's now , i have to the really completely <unk> to do it 's negative to say .
the janitor 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool that it enables me to just really then quickly to be and in <unk> and faster than others , in the competition to launch .
and that i can only , if i am i just do , with both arms me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i need to really the eyes , to do -- -- or they can also open and let 's customers , nothing .
and to then this <unk> and to then on the other one leg and the same way back up and fortunate to here <unk> bit in another , but to actually more and quiet .
also with high shoes .
and this is for me , it 's critical , if i realized , <unk> 'm just said , how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , i tell guy , because i actually just men as <unk> , how do it on the just to say , hey , you got to me the right <unk> do , because the right , it : yeah , ourselves .
the do n't so , he tell me to .
so i 'm going on the one that him the way to make it 's open to .
and that 's like any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can tell me of course not help , but there i just wondered , and to say , well , practice , of you the curve that maybe <unk> <unk> used to make caregiving cool .
or i need , of you like now , riding that you just showed me , it shows how long , the mountain , is because if we the <unk> o.s , because you think that , at some time : now to . but over here .
and kick in again in , like nuts and this thing to it on .
and practice , and then i 've also time the pilot , like it 's the walking is , 'm <unk> forward , the me , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes it , are , do n't know , but let me <unk> .
of why is that for me , it 's also the of salt , the <unk> .
i 'm listening , <unk> -- here , there 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best of time has been times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may i do it , still never been so much faster on how thirty-six minute .
and definitively , forecast the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , are those of <unk> only then you can see when i mean your ears are anti-everything , i went back .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , it . looks and i the way there , my risk of all estimate .
and this is for me one of the very important things why i say , trust is more training and not this banana <unk> .
so you know , ' sake of as a blind now , not much , which , -- from <unk> .
because i already also the experience to me a <unk> right and left there was harassed life .
and then was in the competition and at the bad because it , the way across three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so , like this was -- of course <unk> on .
i know that 's also , because the <unk> to time , the way , to so <unk> <unk> .
and i do it happening today still , that i got people say , left and say then , you actually ne , the other left .
so , but right , unfortunately .
power in life often not much .
but it , <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , anyway , there 's a very quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , like this is what we trust you know , that i the risks they 've got to .
and i have to be honest , i am , as someone who do n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' i took risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now this is pretty all .
the driving <unk> tree , from the slope down <unk> , i know , and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes the important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the universe is actually , to achieve something , the confidence that there is .
and if you get somebody has found that 's actually also a hundred percent of this <unk> , i am i just need .
and the i , are also the same carbon targets , i went back .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key .
you need the goal and i have to leave you actually also clear to me , there 's because actually , trust also gives us ?
because of this is often <unk> faster term , you would , used .
i trust , or the or me , ourselves .
but this very key is , that 's too much depend on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you know , also -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> got out -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , which is very often that just as we also create , rock 'n goal together .
that we do it -- my case , for example of a few weeks i ' i am i on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i need to now somebody for them , or the to the case that can count that i just this mountain , coming up to get .
and how do you the then that you the bell mountain , at some really up there is ?
well i 'd shifted course the giant advantage , i see , some things to do n't see , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was saying that 's relatively unknown .
ca <unk> be an advantage , it 's heights that is no problem .
and i ' , and tried to the most of heights that worked , regardless of the <unk> i am , and to time , i see , and then i did something <unk> <unk> or 'm in berlin <unk> flew , because you will be with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's some <unk> bit <unk> , then when you up there 's and down the car stop , then you have to still not even a lot see , there to know now , do it hurts , if i <unk> .
and that for me , are always been quite interesting .
you to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i can see , the when i think there are so yes , focus , <unk> and can just by but also got a new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because in <unk> mountain <unk> yes , you go on every day after 10 hours ago , and it 's some simple , to get to
you go and go and has , stones . around , and fewer and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun goes from , i 'm first world war and .
so if you <unk> <unk> way , it 's the <unk> about the last of the <unk> .
the only then so the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> only from the distance ever seen or the other one you .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , he and had .
because i thought i '' : well , you , there <unk> ' i probably too far as the the thing you .
but again , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you know , to <unk> actually now , not really much change .
and really exciting is , then , if we did , something hard to .
so then when you in the go and the air became somewhat thinner .
or if it to a well , then when you <unk> little <unk> where 's left and right well .
it 's particularly beautiful and if there 's actually , still accounting night is and all with a headlight <unk> , then at us the <unk> already , specifically , now it would i 'd been to wire , so that he then i was also really in a view , well .
because when i only without a headlight there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we know it was created that i just said i : well , i can course , she , my friend , and it was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> , you and we have this well <unk> .
but i need bees ' time , the ne square of security , so i 'm not permanently focus to be , because , you can imagine , if you the bell mountain just always say <unk> stone , right on one , in 11 .
because you will eventually <unk> , and all .
so is to we trust in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , ham , we have a string theory of your backpack goes to that had to , the and then behind her in which loosely <unk> rope has gone .
had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit of the stairs , this was when i went back .
and it 's then eventually , to find , with the foot <unk> stone had or has with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i 'll also had already , so on me ask if and i 'm not permanently just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , if you , i realized then eventually , the peak getting near that you that goal really back in around the corner store 's -- just like , the <unk> , to weightlifting .
other thing is it , so that i was when i ' suggesting that trust that to me i ' suggesting that is , those who just now if i really <unk> goal and i 'd see , like that the high-water mark .
but that trust is also , the <unk> , like trust just work .
when we then at night of the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , it forward and behind us are the other seven in the time and they were always sort of dense behind us and it has been , every moment was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell you see , why are the because why this because , everybody that he 's behind us can run ?
at night can also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the reason is , it .
and then i ' i look at them , oh yeah , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the darkness , and this is about 12 clock has then why do n't no light .
this is really tiring to <unk> is the air force will be thin , really only still hard and now , it <unk> first place .
and then it 's a but eventually , so the , where the know , have said : man that was really totally in handy , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women wait to do this .
have all the night of us anything about and the others in the group were right there 's also that the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it is now only <unk> hour , that it hit me then told .
or i do you know what 's very different now , not the mountain was telling .
and that to know it 's still a figure out of it may also just lousy about <unk> about maybe we have time talking about -- it are , ne hour , the sun goes as soon on .
what these things that also used mirrors from the outside can trust and significantly increase and can address that contribute to that you so the personal medal but just as well done .
and it 's for me faith , then given and , it will be perfect , if you , so the personal gold and that , just really want to reach , then eventually , in the idea of right there is .
and it 's clear , in sports , with the gold , that you so <unk> -- i know , not know , why is that 's an do -- maybe , i 'm not to the value to test scores or to look , whether it , lead very is ?
so i think ' , for some medals that 's in vancouver , were six grams a hard .
if this all the gold would then <unk> i 'm not here , then i would have the bahamas , think i .
or at least , lichtenstein and <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i think , the real , why you do this , is more that , you ca : i ' i actually been created and how i 've got my skills and very focused on a point .
how i ' to me in my skills , but of course , the team that we all need to get it in school , job in which one thing .
whether an old man or young woman , we do that people , in the we can .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that 's also have reached stores , is that the proof that we at least in a project in our lives that could .
and if you do it once you can then it definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , who came that is , <unk> your nice round of cards .
which i was driving , is the very <unk> effort , science , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
basically , i could satisfaction here .

even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> of magazines in magazines , so the major issues , highly complex , somehow get across the whole .
every station has at a <unk> , where some major issues to process .
this is totally <unk> , if you look like , it , magazines and magazines for children there with scientific issues .
every program , sort of a to cut off in <unk> , but still is that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that can i 'd like to see , i can just like to read , but that now this is i mean , not themselves .
cool , is cool science just sort of , in csi , breaking bad at some there are the chemist cool , actually ne square ?
in csi as a <unk> , five minutes has nothing at with the reality to do , but that 's cool , ne square ?
because i can identify .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes not , but it 's fine .
this is too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox , the future we 'll just manage to these type of technological issues and issues .
but at bay area that none of itself .
i have a few little taste of times the native americans , like science , or science just at us as a given .
so it 's a <unk> example , in london , a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not just , we build the time somehow that this curved .
what happens is now that the sun , in the facade into it , i think that 's an environment is , targets and somewhere in the other that you on a point come together .
this was another large prints through the press , there was actually just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so you know that this poor <unk> , the really long , long to go there are the <unk> time .
there is , you , as an architect , the n't actually sort of times as a little what physics had learned , because i mean , is yes totally new , to a mirror of targets .
so , i found , that 's <unk> , sort of & , in , where he the time with radiation a fleet of an agent .
because i wonder really , has the more design or an architect , where he has been studying lung ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such current to have , is the genetic engineering .
genetic material that 's already now a few years ago , as the so just sort of the media was .
there was the train , that ship , because <unk> changed the plants that was at a danger .
genes that was a sense of green genetic engineering .
genes that were somehow what 's bad .
ne , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations where , on the farmers who actually become a good time , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that 's supposed to be , yes .
so , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but the time , i was in the lab , active in and eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and yet , frustrated , came home , and my day neighbor , i 'd say , you see but it 's happy , is because this ?
i in that i try and there for three days as a little gene in my bacterial cells to transform and this works at all .
that was , what i tried to explain to , sort of a first decoded , genetics , i thought that 's the good , when i of genes are talking to know , you , she says .
that was , what i said , a particular sequence , i there were these <unk> <unk> wanted to .
but that was , the woman in another .
this woman has i 'd never again the driver 's all shook up !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , actually ne square ?
genes is very bad .
this is already now , 10 years ago , and so , the way in awareness ones .
genes that 's kind of what 's bad .
<unk> i quite a long , i wo n't read .
it 's then , gene technology essentially free and it , but really our language there is that .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different to a lot of other corn , yes , not genes that contains .
and a headline writers , <unk> it simply replacing rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
that are but not old and it 's also quite get on what level that i 'd be ways .
if the time or the picture all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , it also , i wo n't long .
but that simply shows that uncertainty in the population is now , because they simply not with the issues to deal .
nevertheless , we have to do in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it be about things are and some of what the most really no idea .
and it 's pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this little kid motivated scientists are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , done something , enough . and he does think , , man 's what , that interested , but the public .
then to the undercover , the professor go .

good idea , i 'm still not the public speaking , it goes to a <unk> .
the <unk> think , , great idea that 's great because we do issue a into it .
<unk> , we have an issue with a project , a fabulous idea , and this is coming then some way out of ivory towers .
this is then <unk> , but , who really ?
now are to institute rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> as a common that , a common <unk> .
and from all these are then the <unk> , really cool projects , then , are about the <unk> to the magazine , means to the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the it will always keep talking about , ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , that actually speak of projects , there were those magazines come up .
that are out on a magazine , are really well done , there 's of all there 's free , yes , and i get i 'm going to work ?
so , basically just the , for interest .
in the <unk> we call it 's always the <unk> the very much .
so that , anyway , for interest , feeds in addition , the newspaper , beautiful and good .
a magazine , the audience , the workforce , for interest , and maybe about an idea have , where <unk> on it 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i do with but really ?
the very , the it anyway , actually .
the way , that was now , and the citizen , i call it 's lord <unk> <unk> , under conditions of the publications reading , i was trying to it 's not to keep hearing , i get i do n't really .
yet again , our future will we only way up to , if you with these <unk> engage .
fracking , genetic engineering , renewable energy , <unk> that are all of topics , <unk> are , mr. <unk> but not really understand and , about the he sort of going to go .
my project , my idea is so what else that we need to these small , young , you get this scientist working out of ivory to take , really completely unaware of his regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course to give a seminar when you how to science really communicates .
what is usually happens that a scientist so i have a buddy , we know that we 've been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a go unwritten rule , it 's not after his job to wonder .
when he got the mouth does and over his career telling it , he 's behind .
ne , that are scientists , tell and then one is kind of <unk> .

since then treated , this is somehow , that does n't know , is .
the really , to pass , that 's enough . if you on a conference are and there your people , your professionals , <unk> anything to tell you would then you 'd like of <unk> tell , but glimpse , say , just water on this .
where is that , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little bit more malleable are , school i , as an argument .
it exists for all of use , <unk> , as investors , let 's also know , there in the <unk> happens .
eventually , are also by the there are used , the key to actually , at the way .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you then we were , a jury her sit and to you 're going to your project a jury , you betcha , who , even worse is it , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , `` if you 's not just tell you can you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how to really , they communicate ?
so the stories , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , on each university , of course , but there also get i basically , it again , the very much .
who is because , <unk> end of the city in the university at some sunday morning , then there , a talk to <unk> times do ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
i 've got back to my <unk> .
so , they 're the people , anyway , of interest , there are driving and there , one to go to get to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done all these are satisfied , all these are happy , driving home , and this is it .
so down , i still on a second aspect to say , it 's not in this <unk> the project .
those scientists are also , trained , how are wired , children ?
because of really second , look at this , the essential to decrease .
because scientists are looking at the research , and how to raise their world and explore , is the same .
so to work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything like learn the way .
they try to say , it work ?
<unk> , fall , we do n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , do it harder , new .
children learn is no science .

this is normal .
but that have a second .
and of why i think , really work that only if , after the <unk> of and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , the environment with the children of kindergarten , from school , there 's all these are the children on their <unk> , and there , really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually , basically the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , this is my hope to tell the kids that actually , and then i get i also , mr. <unk> , then , suddenly , for scientific dispute with very interested , because the kids that he tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him something that it <unk> yourself with a <unk> worked that it 's a bread <unk> that it 's paper is lit shack and understand , and shaking you may also the head , right , as a house can build .
and not just get i then , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it 's still remember , that the first <unk> , i 'd have said , yes , we do <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject , have generously in other priorities .
a scientist to be honest , not to communicate .
i can think then , okay , and i the next .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , there 's in the next moment .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks were horrible .
the weather , we make a lot of this is through the bill did .
in seven , soon after eight years when i have been asked , if i 'm here 's take to .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , and i do <unk> <unk> in munich and <unk> .
we 're there is quite far as a sudden spiking up coming .
had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was actually rather well , that 's <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , , i think that 's ridiculous .
i then , but to know who is and so i 'm standing here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little nuts , but it , so this is also up through emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next 17 , hit eighteen minutes a little bit of life of <unk> tell .
i 'm from ceos in <unk> .
the company because it 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm full of the <unk> .
this company because it 's been 20 years .
and ceo of the <unk> .
the company because it 's been kind of nineteen or hit eighteen years .
that runs the zeppelin here <unk> .
zeppelin .
that 's a picture that i do you here show , the little thing right , this is actually as a red , as a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , this is the same thing is still going to big .
there 's because the only <unk> <unk> .
and that are actually just now , 10 most active .
so that is already what .
there 's about 20 thousand people standing around world <unk> .
this is actually not a market .
this is also not a niche drugs .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then actually ?
how is this really ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 most active , we can afterwards , and talk about why .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> , so many of crazy <unk> <unk> of aviation is created .
very short order .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago at the world around eighteen <unk> the bullseye in '' .
then were in the first world war <unk> zeppelin died by <unk> and 17 , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the , london bombarded by and on and so .
and when we collected 20,000 and eight to london got these are , and a large <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , they do the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time they come up , but not bombs , but in peaceful in itself .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the customer , was not quite pleased to because he suddenly realized it , there , scoop was that old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that , it was for the marketing , critically .
but yet it was in london a great campaign for the weather in north end up there was many years ago , very bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then , <unk> two decades , <unk> 21 hugo <unk> have adopted that .
and has a <unk> for that then to america is delivered the process .
that has a myth challenging things that all the german nation of ritualism , again something felt as is <unk> and <unk> the flying airship has been .
there was the fact , in new york receive up with tape parade .
and all the german nation 's got out has <unk> , we 're back who .
this is in all about this is inside and that 's really explain a little kits that myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , seven zeppelins even still were built and actually just two really big , <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg was , the passengers would be promoted .
passengers , a hundred , around <unk> passive and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was but a myth .
and the <unk> then , at the first broadcast live are an accident , there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
now , the titanic that event that time , where a one icon , a a product of clutter is and then also never , after the flight .
and the different devices have a network .
and <unk> , <unk> the last still exists zeppelins destroyed .
the the materials that 's used for <unk> , <unk> , come by .
then was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , the had the idea , maybe you want to this again .
and i was hired <unk> , because you know , technically a great product that we get the same , but the market .
yes is he does a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still going to explain to we ham yes time on it 's still going to actually ne , who has a lot has done .
there 's many companies , because of corporation that way .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a right of the world , the profitable .
there 's a lot of it .
the world , then i also believe , here on up to come .
the zeppelin , is actually a very ordinary could fly like any other small plane as well , but i 'm sorry , very a gas , helium 's not evolve hydrogen sulfide , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , water , and , submerged naturally , and the <unk> to do .
the time now is n't change that the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin , with a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward no structure and they are sort of how balloons up in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , the world has built by these are , about four , five hundred piece .
and it 's only today , as i said , only <unk> in which was a brisk -10 with our own was , around , two decades .
this is then the production of , if a shell where one is .
the left the structure .
and the shell is too high technology .
comes from the <unk> .
the source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
so it 's one point two million dollars as a shell .
and is to <unk> to <unk> be and also have to <unk> be because , you have to yes , at that if a crack in it would or a hole that 's not going to suck .
there are the <unk> again <unk> do and look exactly that this is going on holes in control .
and end looks a controlled airship on without the south of like it 's there .
the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product
and that you see here is down the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point had six four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights in the year , they may <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
the record indeed .
but there 's a different trend that 's look at about power and the world , i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started ago , 20,000 five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , in the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> that to derive want them , you can say at least in these eight years , of course of an eye of the <unk> , also clear , these eight years has the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can 's 2,200,000 passengers , not going through thick fog .
they want to be honest , something .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year and it .
so a picture of that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day changes .
but because that this is this is now the good afternoon , the european union a program being remade <unk> to do almost 10 million dollars and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come morning is just from finland .
the flying airship is equipped them , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and 20,000 feet .
that means `` planetary <unk> .
and the zeppelin t 's flying from italy , up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds of <unk> measure the and analyzed the air out how the , chemically function , as you to it on our things that we the ground .
so i just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the other airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and it 's when you can be so then and derived from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are , a few 4.3 million .
the flying airship on top of sweden last week or <unk> week .
and finland is by the weather 's going to actually ne , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the finns may say that they were still never .
i i there 's wonderful , a warm days experienced .
that they were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to aubrey de <unk> as <unk> diamond cell for has grown , i said volcanoes go far , underground networks are , their wake up there are , erosion of a million years .
it , this can also ask , is that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you to make sense of questions for an idea to make sense of thing is it makes sense when the same time in cinema , by the <unk> or your blood diamond 's gone .
because i asked the , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what that 's where we really ?
the end , we were , after two years , done .
the `` ode to actually , not on .
so the whole <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then .
and a tornado has the zeppelin the mast , at this broken , that he also going down to be able .
now , not bad .
we were there 's very good for insurance , and we 're quite a very happy .
this was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i want to do with .
what we make a very brief <unk> out of the bit .
what we do it 's all about just to that 's the complexity , it 's the growth or was .
what we do is the <unk> here <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we have to create the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , and devices in after 10 , to do it again , be replaced .
we replace , the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a fast as <unk> the amount of the germans <unk> and of the european supervision in that is , and the time , even more like <unk> , or as an airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and to and also going to get .
the question is do you actually on ?
when you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you there really ?
you go on the market ?
you go further in the tv ?
and the course we have in my time , that
and we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> zeppelin was a couple of <unk> has sustained and this bust .
the early on the billboard stood still the organ donation of <unk> .
the population of german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke was , the population him a donation done .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that way , otherwise we were or <unk> today i do n't here , and other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , san francisco to a customer .
it was a very <unk> investor .
the two projects are actually failed .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we <unk> won .
i 've not a picture because we do that <unk> emblem still not show you can .
but america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a deal with a partner , the technology .
and this is a huge success , but at the i think that there 's uncles .
two who are essentially , liquidate again , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually have been .
it was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go <unk> or in america who knows everybody knew you <unk> the last 30 forty years , advertising .
the ham , people <unk> , the flying airship that , have said , 'd say , again , <unk> , the power .
there can see the did n't that you go there <unk> .
and it was actually , twice as difficult in marketing is that 's over to : hey , people call , and going .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then in a half million .
this is then it .
the zeppelin going <unk> are here .
it 's the sense , the course is beautiful , if i also when ceos , then see how the passengers would get out and , and all laughing and we 're essentially , and she does n't do ads , because it 's mouth to speak about and again , we went about <unk> sold their voucher could have and people saying , this is nice , and highly recommend it your friends , i know , and who also on , in the family .
and we 're great .
which i tried and clean up to deal with the mistake that you think we 're she .
you could still more flights .
we , a <unk> the <unk> and we are she .
so that is actually also , we do .
we do , advertising .
this is a project was that audi sponsored by .
and an audi claimed that , and here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and to look at times , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have yes , to be enough ads , but the internet has much change , <unk> about the beginning because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> that 's why you today is still 10 most active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one put that <unk> , three operas has <unk> bought , 10 are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means we 're then the future , actually , if it does one is more control .
and hope it also again a future that .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo six to his <unk> paris 20,000 and five , he said , answered the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's beautiful .
do ads , we also .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
this is not up and then .
it 's <unk> , goes on and down .
so a as a government takes years until you 're going to get .
and then there 's then again years , no .
there 's also be funny this effect , easy for and hard to control .
anyway , that is a situation , <unk> , a point in global market , actually not a market .
yet we doing on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
they ask , just about the question : what form we make it on ?
how much money we give up in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in what form that supposed to run be ?
and i personally , you made me also asked to something very skillfully , i 'm sure , to my history <unk> , where i <unk> rescue ever wanted to go back against the brain , drag them , <unk> has the little <unk> dead ; it does n't want it 's also here to rescue .
i was also , i put three years <unk> , when i of vancouver island is that 's me , and all of that <unk> come i 've got to me , that this academia , that when i think there i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money , choked and are n't know what they do to be , and it to actually gone .
because they 've got me to employ to think it 's going to retool .
and i have three years , greenpeace was as <unk> and now i do it here of hope , a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , is the house for seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
thank you .
that are my three penalty points , to the eighteen minutes to go to .
why we are today in from mountains , or in wealth ?
how to their ?
and all , to do ?
what 's what is it 's really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it 's also about you know , the challenges to show .
a few years ago about , that , even harder was that fuselage , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we are environmental problems .
but it 's worth , and time to suggest that are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds of <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you put it in a historical long view here 's the oil hits for example , they do that 's a very short , episode in the history has been to be .
today , we ca n't imagine that 's kind of different is about as that oil and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , in the past , there 's time the columbian , we look at the last <unk> years .
that can also <unk> at , love ' i also really .
and you can say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also the ocean is far away .
but it 's then , yes , if you a little bit more closely with listening to sort of real challenge to evaluate things that 's really to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> of health .
<unk> it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's about it all the degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and increasingly , sort of bad .
it 's but also the <unk> , especially in asia .
you think about the himalayas , where the big as it is how and the <unk> of notes on that there with water from the himalayas is .
it 's all , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> what we 're doing , there 's been much larger environmental crisis .
and churning way , but it goes to us to the people , with , in in an altered our ecosystems very uncomfortable will live .
's the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , expanded .
the freshwater equivalent to and less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and all this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , tell you see , i stuck in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
so , we all of the world 's what we harvest .
not just , the oil and the valued metals out and the minerals , but the power resources are , renewable , but the end of scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as possible of use to also all , less food waste and cutting emissions to produce .
so it goes about this is in the introduction said already been the <unk> really to dramatically reduce malpractice .
that 's the challenge , not only climate , c , you two , <unk> of a car on another , but really different life .
another way to rebuilding economies .
our technology , it was going to change .
if we still a look at the hunters and moving forward , and there are still on the societies , so come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> were doing it in the longest time of human history of three to five pounds .
today are it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around the earth .
it 's in north america , more than with us in us more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and other parts of the world , you look in africa , very much less .
and there 's , we call the impact on the rest of us , rivers , there 's gotten a lot better in the last decades , but it 's basically , that we in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the world 's the box , and less like .
and why are also the conflict , we see , ukraine in , is , afghanistan , wherever you look at them in the maps of the american geological survey and then you see where the resources from .
and this is it 's there are very colorful , which means that there 's a lot of resources , the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean , we need to us with the subject to deal .
so we need to change , ecological limits are all the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , we here , <unk> have life is not <unk> .
that has been the mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough for being needs , but not to anyone 's greed .
and there we are , like we here and the average life , a lot about it .
so .
this was the kind of depressing .
but i 'm always that you the needs to understand it 's worth , too , to change .
and if i asked afterwards they would say , it 's worth , like this way to life is more their .
but it is , and out of way , from <unk> <unk> you need , a rationale , tell you see , i time .
now , which is actually their ?
and we need to find that we 're in our to share the world of a lot to have an economically , socially valued choices , quality , standard , about us , across , often do n't feel comfortable .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people , not so good can deal with this story .
i first time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate change have the same cause .
we 're a weight and to do .
this is on the one where we get yourself in stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very much like .
and on the other cause we that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we can this is defined ?
now here 's a a scientific break .
this is also , i 'd say and that i guess what i later tell me is scientific , grounded planes , but it there 's about it 's drum , how to become , first time is defined ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
life has the aspect of the objective conditions as it me is about what i want to eat . surplus .
i was a roof over the head ?
i friends ?
i really , i 'm alive , participate ?
but just as well , how 's me with , how do , i was have to talk about grievances ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words pop into , at the spot to work .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental way our human development , our there is , to mediate emotion .
if we need is we can , we 're happy .
and what we can do n't need are sustainable , or not sustainable .
needs by se 're still not for <unk> .
what are needs ?
can different place in a quote , i here 's only two called .
and there you know , the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , and more , we 'll enter , creativity , spirituality , for freedom .
it has a little bit about with money to do .
but to a lot of you do n't actually , but the question is how can i think that in my life delicately set up .
so , i did the second important term .
the therapeutic strategies .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to 's available to me that needs to perform .
and there 's it 's , and then , you know that i can become , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can actually much money to hire or a little money to work .
strategies that are just saw my behavior as i think about my needs <unk> .
it with my values to do with the resources , with the ways , i .
if i was a little money while i 'll see , i different from my needs to try to meet as if i said , so much money on the bank account of have .
it 's first of the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and then you know , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , it , sustainable , or <unk> .
and if we all the strategies , i have available to stand to my needs to satisfy us to summarize then we talk about one of lifestyle .
so .
this was the kind of scientific break .
and now is , you know what we can start to do ?
how 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of reasoning .
obviously has to this , and everybody for instance , which i find .
but the clues to the individual flavor of on a technological way , here is that one , i , much , talk about technology 've been and finally , of a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides the beginning , sort of the danger is that we kind of , and more affluence and more resources .
the end of the quality back down because that , the effects , even worse , and on us all , back to beat them .
or , whether we do it to speak , there in a different direction go , with less <unk> , maybe with less mindful consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , which is better life with less <unk> .
there 's it 's a lot of technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee the car , the traffic , how to that make ?
cement , i can today , not make i can do that house of wood to build , etc .
and with a much less <unk> more or the quality to create .
my other teachers <unk> <unk> that , so that 's really , the <unk> per <unk> , and we 're at the , we also now , talking to have been is there 's it 's very deep sense that on it 's a company to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what we can i really satisfy us ?
and how to , as little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of this kind of whom it can .
in vienna , to a seven-story building be built with two are allowed .
with seven allowed is it <unk> already built .
that basically , from wood to this is .
that you , if you may recognize it in fifty years , i wo n't need to dissect it does and then again in its parts and not so , so , very much less resources out it with everything else , comes out there of in the moment , over half and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , about the whole lifetime of the house ever thought it with the fifth of <unk> long .
it 's but also a lot in our own human beings , like <unk> ' i really ?
elena <unk> has a book written <unk> .
where he shows to show how it all , is , really from the from the woman , from this treadmill that come out .
the <unk> , i me , go over the others come after , and then i , forever , in this in this race in .
you have , has become , but , i quickly getting from , and then they do , i the new .
the most love ' i the <unk> that you know about all .
when i debuted at that what i did some years ago , we still receiving letters started writing .
then , with , wait to the letter back to write , i ai email , is a hell of <unk> .
to write , i have hundreds of emails .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we come to that in .
but i did n't really time to go .
i have to me in a failure done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground for .
and a low <unk> more quality to do .
one of my favorite is <unk> .
there 's the best-selling book , they have it does that a average person we had in germany , in austria 's about 10 things in domestic chores .
you can time to count .
if you have two , three generations of thousands of things had servants , personnel .
the have , we manage .
we must have to deal .
and and fewer people come with their with these all options .
and we need a field guides , the us and help of us and <unk> with these few things go .
if only ' one , i really interesting is perhaps , ai n't use the spaceship that 's going to , one , i , not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead of having .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , there has become , maybe twenty years ago , somehow , in alternative , you were evolved .
meanwhile , use it 's going to , people , when you <unk> think .
if you to <unk> think .
platforms , business models that just to work , how can see the things that we already have this beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years was built , still , use and still about the other centuries of the situation is just that 's the end .
this , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal : that 's take it 's a picture association between africa and europe and a a delightfully diverse world .
so that all the same with these resources to do that 's only then you can see when we really can use less .
and that is because it 's not less quality , because of us has been sort of a weight .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , these are actually available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point that has also something with the big going to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i the time .
if you a little attention the projections were reading , it 's been back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections back down to change .
it means , a crisis that 's in the door , my view , and after the , we kind of a lot of the top economists have been talking and with listening have , here are the numbers of austria , you find , that for all countries growth is going to just down to .
and there 's no reason to growth , have the way that as i believe that from my youth , from the 1960 years know .
the part that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth , fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , china today .
that are also about where we may be a fifty years .
in the pie bigger it 's kind of course it harder , eight percent of his game .
the one percent is still much , so we will be good living .
but we have to become , you put up , which is not even if we were zero percent growth would have , would that the next year just a lot of , and consume and incomes , like this year .
that we can , and so we can work .
and this is why not so powerfully wrong , because you these statistics all know , showing that 's been ' , it with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in , we countries , on the , we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth as possible , and this is not all that we came together , how the us , of <unk> and how they all this suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you have to found , time with the economy going .
and it 's coming again , and increasingly , that , also <unk> like a more or next week , one , i , comes in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
already <unk> , edward olympian , who was a nobel prize in his <unk> to myself that he said , the good life the good global economy , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
they 're about it all , and not to not primarily to shuttle returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , for china , for india there 's a very different story .
and that will be in , then that are also under <unk> , if we there are , still growing let and we simply become , on this level , on this high level , we 're good on life and economies .
it takes it transcends politics .
it targets .
it going to say the economists .
it does n't just sort of the growth , but we should actually look and measure and what about , the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
then also our politicians .
of course , like this is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a basically boiling point of which is the <unk> finally able to tax avoidance and not work .
of you in the entrepreneurs of you , but also the employees , that for a very good .
what , drive away , we know , in a colleague paid .
so that could you very differently .
the resources are one of looked down and so among the resources in place and not work .
and to the end of <unk> to change , combined employment of law firm to <unk> to ensure health infrastructure , without growth .
this is , but it 's nothing to play , sort of a little bit better .
that means that conclusion , sort of , all levels it in this direction the work to be , we can be hard , we can be a company of the right , services as a consumer sort of us questions , we need to actually , who do that what 's kind of good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the politics choose the framework , we set .
a couple of i described .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the way , how we can that grow up ?
now , but unfortunately , nobody ever done .
if you the projections look if you the development can look at the last two years , it 's always the bottom , because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth of creating , but that 's the question how we go with the to figure out , so that we have a good life of ?

be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , brain , your hand , and the end , the spirit , we have to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this city , so many stories to tell .
one of them , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , right , and in history of a little bit later .
they will have to do with the citadel <unk> .
this is a <unk> , there in the middle of the city is , and so much of this city , which and does shape .
one another story of this .
it was on a hot summer , he went , nevada .
a man is , once in his shoes that really that it right <unk> .
that he did to 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so the heat .
he makes a result , one he pulls the shoe of take a knife <unk> also not a spike in , and several times makes towns and lots of holes in .
he pulls the room , which is being raised knife and we realize it has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe store , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the place in the forbes list of these billionaires are on the morton <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> that way , with four letters .
the bottom , or another kind of you know it .
he 's the original idea , nike even and adidas are .
both have died .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> he goes to the stock market .
about today , several thousand on in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much to the creative problem-solving .
why not something to re-set up , we still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has told me , often did , in a tough .
if something wrong fluke is or my collaborator heralds me or technology does n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what 's an opportunity ?
and it comes from <unk> the <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the 100 franc included now , and the <unk> story of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people who can be the subject of their own insurance more about .
so i want to a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that was in the 100 franc included , and that has it also a commercial gesture . .
i love ' the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , about this is the wife by the <unk> fallen out .
or , i had all day plants is where i did when the way up all of a lady picks up in my view , and i could the other car , i wo n't see .
very clearly , who 's one is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> and two teams , almost died .
because they can see me , but at least half the <unk> in on .
the last i was at the crash , do n't blame .
this was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is each other pieces now obsolete .
but if you a woman who are going to understand it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish i , and dreams , that we all more of creativity use .
many of us in a <unk> <unk> .
and do n't have to be that .
why not things just a do differently ?
old one of things that we do the present there has become are , we may already be bored , or <unk> , as the opposite .
why the not just a way to the <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , using this .
so for <unk> , but these <unk> of their path run up , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there is then maybe that it .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay instead , <unk> .
or so .
we have n't available , <unk> you .
is yes , today , not my way .
if you the cell phone not something you can .
or you eat at me , otherwise starvation , we both .
rude , but creative .
that it 's .
i only ' one of the client or an environment that then go would and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i went .
a german <unk> has the case , i just the current day <unk> , in <unk> .
once the sport , the current economic news , once upon politics .
if you , there 's three on the loo was there is that you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , you had the chefs take all of hands of to do .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , collectively , we do ?
how we solve that ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is to form .
on every one table is an act <unk> <unk> set of fresh olive salt , pepper plants and a <unk> .
so that the an environment in the waiting on it to eat their <unk> before , which 're able .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person is the power , currently not just popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german trajectory .
already the second day , it 's still a monday , four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of a month , who , and you have no may already , which you .
a <unk> rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus who are full , it 's <unk> run , people together , she was because each of course , one of the way , of a boca , to b .
but why it 's also be something to use and creatively from his biggest disadvantage do something like ?
sometimes it 's customers , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it , like this company that you might .
so we have god , you know that , which is what the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they accumulate in the <unk> also , saving to 's something rather alarming .
or the <unk> in the car .
because we know that , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car on , if you <unk> is ?
or at <unk> there 's also have , creative , to design .
and that has to do it with humor with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , actually ne square ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son with me the office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , he 's delight , and i held in the stinking <unk> say , to the you to stop on , this is yes not a playground here .
he said to me , look at me , big eyes , the playground .
and the moment <unk> ' i actually he has been right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that what we 're doing , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , when we have our talents to use to do that , we like to do .
and so as excellence in , but it relaxed way .
that appear to is that , if a particular day the week , then it changes , what our brains .
it 's the first day in the week and it 's our focus on a different day .
so one another day , we usually prefer to .
so the weekend .
that you hear yes , already in the media .
the having is yes , , only a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced that is , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we 've all those jobs ?
a <unk> it had time , on the front , this topic .
monday , you see , i and the rest of life , please find ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook all over the social media is this issue up .
once was i went through <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look at the like .
what have the in the <unk> , there 's because this ?
and one day stuck i get in this business with these signs to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , this is yes , actually quite neat .
so , with this love doing , i 'm going to work .
i <unk> that yes , that i 'm father of five kids , but i 'm also my work anymore .
yes .
or still working for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , there is it becomes , which is increasingly , and always on .
somebody has been there 's as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i ask even in fact , the pink , glasses , this forward to come and , okay , just do a shift .
what , on my job is beautiful ?
this silly is , although it 's the pink , glasses is it looks like all the same as before .
so something nice to talk , this is n't beautiful , in it 's obviously not .
the pink ribbon in this is great for bicycle on driving .
there holding them a wonderful , the flies by the else in your eye that would .
but to <unk> advice you ca n't .
that lead to , if we do n't that change ?
in fact of , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , more self-sufficient .
it ends in , a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this bike and running and running and there 's now , and eventually it 's going to this wheel it hits the mouse and it out there .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know that , nothing else , you go back in the <unk> .
after year , and again , maybe the film that she acknowledges me that <unk> you may all of you know , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , they do , because failure and it goes again and so this field .
and that , we as funny feeling probably has the mouse looking at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something that it 's that <unk> <unk> .
i think about many years ago , so when i grew up in the was from a seminar when home .
and suddenly , was , so the street , i felt it was very black , my eyes and somehow got to see , i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , there is this ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically all right .
but how it 's associated with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , the to check , and saw , i was score three weeks , and kind of great fact i was also the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first thing in the early been wondering whether we look at night in the end you can make .
i also thought , there 's actually anyone else , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again other priorities straight to me , to let me to time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me , which i 'm doing .
<unk> ' , whether it ai n't other <unk> there in my job , a new kind of .
i was , go to get a large groups , make me , great joy .
i 'll see , again , and seminars and also other things , but these talks by pulses be able to , so with exchange , for me , great joy .
and this was n't always .
i was have to recognize that this <unk> out about what does .
and sometimes it 's really this shot of the <unk> of me that 's degree back from left the hospital after he 's a heart of them , and suddenly , it also , , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you leave with some jogging , he has always impressed me <unk> , yes , you with your running and .
today 's it themselves .
so with <unk> , beautiful slow , right <unk> , but eventually we will also , so jogging go .
what ?
the bottom line to all of health .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , as this is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the time last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , that will be less .
rise of psychiatric disorders plus & percent .
that 's something where i think , to the way to be ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria as ?
well , in germany , it 's .
<unk> , a circulatory system , this is all healthier .
this is here on the left to recognize .
bottom all psychiatric disorders , plus a hundred percent of the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> psychiatric drugs treat it to .
and the opportunity cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , we can do with this subject ?
do this -- sometimes form , it , involuntary <unk> have , here .
so it 's good meant .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol of it 's no solution .
but then is the solution ?
what is then that to us , again , healthy power and it and joy is ?
and that , i was the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that actually be ?
i 'm out , the job is not equivalent to us <unk> too , and happy to do .
there 's many other things that are important , family health think , etc .
but in fact is , as we the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , then why not that 's how do that 's take pleasure and years , and by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> ' worth a last , offer to fix that <unk> and to <unk> this .
these little had no , you , hopefully then this is .
<unk> is for our talent and those positions , liberty and environment .
that is , like <unk> ' i 'm talking about talent away ?
in which the environment , ' i think that , with whom ?
that freedom and i 'd see , i 'm here to do that , i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of the <unk> , the us <unk> .
the more of the more stressful .
and what i do this ?
the manifestation .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for instance , which i check .
i had this for me remind ourselves by a few years and i do this is constantly and again .
i can use my talent and work ?
in which the environment ?
and that means that sometimes i go in a coffee with my laptop to get the shortest seminar prepare a <unk> .
the freedom .
that freedom , can i take to do that , i there 's important .
and i do it ?
the manifestation .
the last ted u .
and then there 's , people , me to explain why that 's not about .
and why this at them much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
you 're not fearful , reasons .
and by the point , this can choose your love ' i ways to get ' i ways , i ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do we with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you have his great <unk> figure out .
that is yes , far too small .
that 's filled with talent , with the gold , with all , with her skills .
what do this ?
by the year we ask this .
or if we 're in hospital will be or the end of life .
what i with my talent and shakers ?
the way , who 's got tired , <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards she 's still access .
so what do with our talent , is my first question , as well , i hurled myself , and every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i 'm going to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i want to the spot , still do .
these fortress which was the salvation of the <unk> ago when some five hundred years the hostiles were coming .
and the men realized that the fortress so good built was that you do n't take could .
thick walls a sharp ways , <unk> the fortress , thick and doors , over , this on .
was <unk> time .
so i thought , this , okay if we do n't get in , we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
let 's look like , ' yet that there , endurance .
the <unk> it was some of long till the day came , where the stock up almost out it was .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way it to be as the <unk> , bishop of the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
suddenly , look down the how about the boundary in the fortress is a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right , and in the early .
well , thinking , the ways , a <unk> , what is that already .
it 's an afternoon .
again , <unk> stages , on top of the wall of the fortress , now this is it , black .
enemies are thinking , , that still has two <unk> , it can see , say , take .
at night i did the scenario , this is he knows the <unk> , there , and do is led .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> 've got down they pulled in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us to long , that i think we have not anymore .
and then the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the you colored .
that are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that all right there is what we need , and that we have everything .
're sometimes it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little bit .
but also so we can but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and what we out through know there is the snow ? because it 's getting there 's the plants , from teens brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there are blooms eventually come from these blooms fruits .
there are an apple 's very popular throughout the then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain then we can get ground and staff of baking .
there are there any animals , that eat .
there 's people , then the products just ran out later on food .
and it 's automatically .
but if you think about that perhaps not all that automatically translates everything is it 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very , theoretical , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant are bees a very large numbers matter .
there 's research that can show that to <unk> percent of our food that certain foods we do n't there were when we do n't bees have .
and this sounds , so <unk> , because it 's normal for us is and we need bees might also did not perceive .
there 's now some time ago , a very interesting movie , <unk> , to talk .
and i 'm going to tell you look at it 's cumulative .
now , but look forward , we 're going on the lord <unk> the universe is just with honeybees are working , his off-the-grid school , <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that 's he shown here in a school in <unk> and he 's going to us now some of his work to tell .
please , <unk> .
good evening .
first time a quick thank you is , mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something to about the lives of bees .
and the way , under a wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell this is fun .
because i think to give me that the most of you <unk> in these are it would be so tonight is a <unk> companies you eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to .
that i do n't , no .
but perhaps make it to get them to you to these <unk> start to love or a kind of empathy go to them to develop and you to go out for this <unk> true , <unk> insect in the honey .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years has 'm with a wonderful woman father of five children still not <unk> and i have different <unk> and a lot , and been working <unk> the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest on the <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and the urban beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , a play of <unk> <unk> and a pile of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is more like a make peaceful , a quiet a steady thing .
and it is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> matter .
and do n't have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey and so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet you can find out to spark that it again , it .
but the <unk> go there was n't understand myself down , but they send their blue are bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , wax printer and we crawl in the mouth inside and out with him later the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully i can really that , tonight .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the men 's now my students with me , we 've built comes for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us <unk> the school or the <unk> in the college of <unk> or the <unk> , <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> or in classrooms with us <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied by going to me in the class , and we 're looking for a computer place for a <unk> .
most of the window to kids that can see during this month .
and of all things , to bees , then there are in the blow up out and again <unk> .
there is then the window of the slot .
so .
and then starting the whole thing with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so as a <unk> and <unk> ' right away from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and i 'm you 're now here in these <unk> in .
it on this on this <unk> are sterile so bees .
also important , we have here <unk> their , and here to the perimeter , fresh their be , fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there is the honey is inside .
the need if you 've got a bad weather is and you do n't fly .
so .
it looks like then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation , for <unk> places , or , for <unk> the school .
, and then something wonderful .
my ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there that then in the class at my experience of crisis .
her people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he said that <unk> -- that he put more attention that the queen the old people are left .
that the n't so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad watching these bees .
they 're starting to roaring .
the <unk> they are roaring .
you hear that .
they just sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
, and a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night that they are right now , the need a new people to the planet , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , regardless of conferences , without having grown-up , opinions and post-doc positions .
here is the people , agree and it bulges and in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks , i wo n't exist .
because <unk> only live for six weeks .
so .
and that first night , they 're in this <unk> a felt out an egg , and bring that these <unk> in .
and there into it 's to then a queen .
everybody knows , of you <unk> in the high school saying , how to do that go ?
after all genetically <unk> , there 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
, and then something wonderful .
this an egg what 's normally in the <unk> a worker would have is in the <unk> a queen .
the egg here 's the first three days on the same genetic code , sterile female .
after it gets fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and instantly it changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> get through <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , heard that , we eat this is , from us will .
and in the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days and so egg , five days <unk> .
and that can be the students all which .
you see that in education .

no , that happens <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students to eight days , my graduate student knows , three five times eight a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and if that then so to happen , the teachers has this down in the <unk> there <unk> the internal alarm in the students each morning to five o'clock , yes .
and , the mother , tell you know what 's because with you go ?
i have to the school .
why that ?
our founding queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the to <unk> down here , <unk> , which has to the way the queen now <unk> .
and if you that really to experience then hear it first thing .
the queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cut the queen going free .
the first , the queen , they spread her wings , and there are now with their <unk> that people what happens to have a queen who has their own smell , you <unk> , their pheromones .
the people who has now again an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen is fed orally .
the <unk> front get them their <unk> <unk> .
back , they turn out , from the people out of this <unk> .
and after five days going into the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some kind of what i do it 's seen , as a <unk> in <unk> .
it means stop .
what different .
-- that we let me .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , was invited to figure out of this <unk> out to two miles high .
they have surely , seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and is there is this , an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the like in islam where the guy is different women have to this is the queen , seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way , in flight .
the drone will come back of <unk> the queen , and the queen of it now this an flight that all , you to seed need to three years , eggs to put one .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , you and it has died from the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts to lay eggs to put one .
there 's always two students in the class , that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then it ends up slowly across the project in school , because now to the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the sterile female 's going to intimately intertwined in there .
and then come to one night , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> and the next morning <unk> ' i do this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and you see it 's still the queen .
yes .
then <unk> .
and the way around , 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this one this <unk> are now here 's a <unk> .
in a full cane , a 737 falling prey and now can imagine that people the big and in one .
why are bees in the school ?
my ladies and gentlemen the kids that have seen , forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not only that , in this class , the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes in this class in .
and the teacher , when he said something you know , when he said something like , when it 's when he said , a little prepared , the can an era , the other people .
look , bees and a time ago <unk> years , we 've cave paintings , where the people , the honey and it .
a few months ago , in israel cost of years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees .
any human culture has to poke bees flying together .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture .
in china , india , to persia , egypt greece in rome .
so they were in .
the human of life , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
it can get a <unk> , a <unk> hook , it can get a <unk> join .
my ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , trees and the bees <unk> , you need ?
that they get out there is now is something now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the gardening , and flowers are bees are able , <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right away from <unk> to my bright flowers ?
how long they 're looking at the size of those blooms ?
and how long , they need , they come back .
it can get a <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that this is that , in the <unk> the top of a sudden spiking up or it 's a flat on a sudden spiking up is ?
a look exactly .
it can get a mathematics -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can do with the students , the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then he comes to the question , like it was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought has to the bees can see that in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , a hive if it 's pitch dark .
that 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> of the university , she has the has in <unk> discover that the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , <unk> and deliver , and the bees , <unk> , the up with your legs , with her <unk> .
you see what these bees in school , do ?
it 's <unk> par excellence , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
you know <unk> , look , the bees do .
and you get a be aware of these creatures which basically , just for us human lives .
the bees to wax prints , it 's a kilo of a seafaring people in the year .
ago <unk> years the only way , and candles at making .
they 're going to the budding out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , fix them their people .
and now imagine , imagine in summer , that are their sixties , , <unk> bees on this one narrow pitch black room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases with no end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and you to him that ferment , he 's going to <unk> , a able <unk> .
, someone to the <unk> has got pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now going to a <unk> go , and a <unk> to make the notion that he the <unk> from the people breathe .
of course , there is a grid that , and <unk> with a <unk> and so , because they do n't happen .
and then my ladies and gentlemen , that for pollinating the remove the do the bees , of course , and we have a bad apples , if the bees , are you fly would sooner or we would like the chinese men 's the <unk> <unk> and they have , locally .
there 's much more now .
you look at the <unk> , there on the meadow is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows grazed down .
and there are flying through the bee up , their nectar and fermented -- these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and , the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick it , they digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and then gives the bee 's the most important , it in a lot of the nature , there .
the honey .
i want to know , just to the point <unk> .
my students to be delighted , every year when you these <unk> build and then the part of me in infrastructure , the schools go .
that 's now not my <unk> but once i had a student and watching because i said in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you find ourselves .
and then he says , yes , i get down , <unk> <unk> .
i came from <unk> in <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm , let me that i now , it with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , hit the secondary school .
and more than half of said , we want that 's also .
my students see here 's an enormous appreciation and the put between , unquote , normal and the said in people get through the bees , salvaged .
on playing with them , and they have confidence , my students and a proud .
what comes to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , like it comes to <unk> the <unk> ?
and what i think , i , it 's the man who renews the other people <unk> and he had a new <unk> there .
and he says , so we got to worry .
the end of a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun shining through the <unk> feel the way to flower 's , and never the way to lose the opposite sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived he 'd ever want cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in god .
so welcome to talk at my project .
this project of this person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for an end of the female genital region .
in my eyes the greatest crimes of humanity , because it , their for a thousand years .
the society against the women with many , six thousand sacrificing a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i came from hamburg .
there was i <unk> years a <unk> .
well , you can think that i on the job is not <unk> .
but i was n't <unk> .
and so i was happy that i fell in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting been cross the could .
so for this .
with a massive <unk> about the news from africa to brazil .
on the sail a plea to the <unk> brazil , for the genocide in the wild indians from the <unk> , to stop .
this was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet , we were these large amounts suited to engage the media to find and even a small person who , i was his cause global in the language into .

then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were who of the killings .
and despite all the cruelty , we were experiencing , we experienced the other side of infinite hospitality of the <unk> , we go into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted down , and our two was invited , you see here , with their bodies as living took us , <unk> , and the defender does said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something similar , in one another culture .
and then in a young couple years now , learned that you conceptualize islam is not can reduce the terrorism .
and christians who want to be honest , not be reduced in their terrorism .
so for the <unk> .
the -- he , <unk> .
but rather live in real value as shifting charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
that are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , along with my wife <unk> .
and there were then we went from this <unk> female genital region .
when i then heard that nine-tenths of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> i ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , to all of terror , it 's still <unk> in the shoes do so let me ?
and the idea was the highest masters because of islam to all the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for in the germans organizations , we do n't have found .
because we had done , but now we would be honest , i 'm grown completely <unk> that islam is n't <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty and then we have <unk> our own organization has created .
and were kind of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and now to this battle , even get to we needed images .
it was a scarcity .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad ? '' -- images , i 'll show you do n't , but i just the crime looking out .
girl at the age of four weeks to marriage will look at some of their parents and related up , on the earth are placed you down , on the limbs and you keep them without anesthesia , the clitoris right and the <unk> go up with a <unk> the <unk> to , regardless of anesthesia , if attendance instruments , it has come out of hygiene , anatomy and the <unk> can attenuate this .
what you 've left is a small aperture of the size of <unk> .
for a minuscule part , and a few minutes .
if they typically get torturing her , you two weeks .
never been destroyed , body and it 's their dignity .
this was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the night about it on .
the man to open it .
he has , has never <unk> she saw .
the uncle , he said , like ibrahim , there 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> a and then one you very hard .
and if you do n't it as if you , is not bad .
then take you the knife and does it on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
this had three months ago for .
in shock has the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , some in asia .
the most are house is king .
and , when we are muslims who said , why you did this ?
was the <unk> answer that we need to do that 's in the koran .
there 's in the koran declares it , quite the .
everybody believing <unk> times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe me , you there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and so , well as <unk> person having to women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first key contributors in this was sultan .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the thing that , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to him one .
as recently have to be the sultan this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know , only that has to these people are valid .
and it was celebrating and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , , from mauritania there <unk> us the highest spiritually , the <unk> the country on his message that 's a crime is , `` tooth and writing and this now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your own camels .
hundreds or `` we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality experienced .
and when we the place where eventually leaving to say , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries in ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you did n't be more .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and you have to slow to the thing .
and all , he had an idea .
he said , if you can really , 10 <unk> muslims in the world , a table to and the reason for the need to sin , it is a sin .
<unk> and i flew to cairo summed up in the <unk> and , mosque to the vatican , the very much .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened at the idea , was thrilled , especially , his notion that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's about provider , support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not only <unk> , as we 're going to being asked had , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and he did .
over cairo <unk> at the years <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban on the <unk> the female body through l.a. cut .
the <unk> the <unk> professor doctor , ali <unk> .
and all they are coming .
a century was invited me , but the highest in the world .
in the <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and in the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death to move .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i 'm here <unk> me , vacuum , and <unk> personal .
and then i they all your surroundings .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of woman was mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the system that islam is not <unk> .
we were also doctors , by the on their way , <unk> , well , you women 's where does , with the <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to show , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they dressed , back behind closeted kind of doors , only two hours had to try and a <unk> written a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in the cameras , announced , you decided to .
and the single sentence in this was this .
female genital stimulation is a <unk> to reinforce the defender retaliates against the highest values of islam and it .
it , the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation even without our hosts done .
because the shame , over the abdomen using the woman to talk , is stronger -- stayed thrilled than any mind .
so we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference was documented in this was called the golden rule book .

and because there are <unk> , the <unk> , it as well , i found that book , he 's a , you .
it 's going to us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then at conferences have to look at highest clergy like .
and you read this with interest in some were so thrilled that it 's book , stands .
unfortunately , have the most not the courage to put that well , to announce that .
over the abdomen using the woman you 're not allowed to in the mosque to talk .
some , have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities , at the squares .

and then it out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are all , the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going out of time .
it are all of the hot rocks , and so i work , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the need to stop .
but my <unk> that this .
i want to the great message of the highest clergy the world telling the birthplace of islam is here by the kaaba in mecca .
in fact , not so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there are four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with that the food and we 've seen the king my transparent up there is between the law forbidding minarets taut across .
how i showed this before , trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately i 've not robocop , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> it would join .
for one of these women to help .
to another , to the time to show that the true value of islam that are , instead , and actually demonstrate .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i may have this , in hamburg , naturally .

and we transparent and if you .
and maybe do n't know how i do it , that little girl puts his daughters , i wo n't real .
then , my life that 's worth .
and i appeal to the right now it 's heard or seen has to join .
and she does n't be part is a <unk> .
we really have to practice , looking at this has otherwise the time i 'm here from this stage , not decline .
and now i want to conclude the design of my <unk> , show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there it , we actually , in german .
female genital stimulation is with the koran , and the global ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so i start again , so that time .
so , we <unk> from , you 're a refugee , in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mom , my brother and i was the first time as a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mother was completely terrified , because they do n't understand it 's why the us now rotten food for granted .
the third day , we finally get resolved .
we were the trash to the stuff back to throw away then came a <unk> wife and those who 's just fiercely against <unk> .
they tried to us to explain hey , that can eat .
this is not well .
it tastes , very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , which is that goat -- but the has not <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i my mom and my brother of china , germany had fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but importantly , it 's going to me about to the people that an escape that controls have and to a success did .
but first tell you see , i gave them where i just come from .
i 'm <unk> .
uyghurs are a little <unk> , in the northwest of china .
and this region is the chinese that would be in <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles of the germans go away .
in china to live in 10 million uyghurs but in munich is the <unk> community of china .
and the uyghurs life so here because we 're in china under constant rights have to .
hundreds of chinese were extra to <unk> moved to live in our own home to a minority become inconsequential .
our own native language , <unk> was from the education is basically .
in schools and university will , to speak chinese were taught .
and our religion can we also not free out .
the uyghurs losing so their culture and identity .
and if , a bold and she is for the right the uyghurs in risk of sentences torture , or even after death .
this was also the reason why my parents , for 've decided , with us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is in a game of escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time to leave me .
i <unk> , let me , many people , us in the run have helped .
i <unk> , let me , many images .
i <unk> , let me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it right in me , if i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had a <unk> , , and we met him , with its unique , right on a parking lot .
the first of the rate has to vomit .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business plan to refugees use , and not for the fates are interested .
but i want to see , say i want to see , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> that has conducted months of hysterical .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure through <unk> up .
airport in <unk> we 've come out there , and i know , my mum saying , somehow he said to me is just turned out of the airport .
and around you .
until we are out .
because i had , in my hand , along and there was also my photo in but there was a total stranger whose name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through <unk> .
and i <unk> , let me , <unk> <unk> the me at he had my watch out in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were at <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' , i lot of the first responders , we give a very strongly supported .
i <unk> , let me of the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least for children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , slept and done homework .

it 's my <unk> the <unk> in the college . know me know .
they knew my story and ostensibly in me very and you care , to me .
for example , it brought me to <unk> <unk> what i now , i wo n't do .
but it helped me , somehow , german people were to meet .
i spent my whole place where the <unk> .
it was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids with her husband and in the uncertainty is because we had , a different factions , and could any deported .
i <unk> , let me that i really , aggressively was the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i have to simply to my history .
i was really aggressive and to me in school , one of focus .
the 1980s brought us find out to a catholic <unk> where we the first time to normal children will come .
with a normal my darlin ' i children , not in a <unk> to live in fact , to .
i <unk> , let me , the <unk> the me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent training
just so we bit out .
i <unk> , let me , several <unk> <unk> the us , the homework done have , because our parents do n't speak german , could .
or the have to us just did .
we 've always very happy .
i still , how we always the big fence line up and waited until these people came , because , somehow were to strangers who were looking for us time , and this was telling us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
that was but that it directly from <unk> , <unk> relegated to , because it in munich to prison is no more for him there .
i <unk> , let me of the very , who had a lawyer improving the it managed to my father , <unk> to china to protect us they made it even that he we had in munich , having me .
i <unk> , let me of this time where i really , very happy was , because after six years <unk> to do we finally in a regular apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years and we had finally one own apartment , your clothes and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have desk in but it was good , i was my door that .
and i <unk> , let me that i the time , very well used , but i had yet the college , without a research has left .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , me in <unk> always been supported them , and it still do with the idea that i know about the second reason initially , my degrees <unk> .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought bruises and i was really not just the time , managed to it actually going to middle at 16 .
and i , <unk> .
and before i , <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of international organized <unk> .
but i was n't a <unk> that i ' i also only done because we go through <unk> a place , where we simply could go .
we had a valve that what we aggression , out to praise .
and the leader of <unk> helped us some way that we are able to tell you could and he was ostensibly , and we could tell us in all wondering what somehow help .
and i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a closing the possibility of this , my artistic <unk> .
that 's what i really very well done , and i was , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the film <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and by the won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because there 's still never had experienced that people 's listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , ok .
i , i wo n't do n't .
i something comes from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees and give me on the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to tune .
but there to the bold building totally enveloped me that had i ended up to live in a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the good thing is , after a performance alongside two editors in the <unk> publishing down on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just let 's own <unk> .
i said , super , the golden ticket .
you 'll see , i do with .
and i made for the radio <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> on it .
and i told him , actually won .
now coming up i 'd done the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year and <unk> the <unk> .
and it would have to me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me being used to have .
they have to me believe they have to me spaces continually open , they 've got to be ways i’ve shown that i thought my place in the society me into it .
and to come , i now to them .
everybody 's got the way of people like to help second chance to get and their lives , or their place in the society to find .
because , people in every day come some hundreds of refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it 's great determination to many terrible is behind , to them .
and this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and be for every one of us as well .
and i could actually thousands of objects tell you can make , but i , i wo n't enough time i even though there is , a minute world , i have you a <unk> brought .
it out and they 're going to your appendix out they ca n't tell me tell you to be no code scan .
we scan them , the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities for me , they have no way to do .
and that would allow us all right now .
i thank me now , for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan them , the code a .
i just know , it .
many have the cell phone , not in my hand .
you are so i 'm going to become , or ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
just a <unk> is i did .
i 'm hoping that we connect .
my name is a robin chase .
my <unk> is write , simpler than it happen to speak .
i come , of austria , this is in vienna .
i 'm , let me , today <unk> to attend that 's really beautiful here .
i 'm in a here every time very comfortable .
and this is not just spouting cliche , that 's a sense .
yes , as opposed to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , you about anything to start telling .
i was not that , which .
but it is that i text would write in my spare time and then some talk , right , in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just events like the world today .
and i was also today we asked , here 's a couple of text to read the bottom the program a bit of bursts .
and that 'll see , i 'm going to do here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
and meet , two million chickens .
she says that 's a are two english chickens and i <unk> , and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> before , very funny , i <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
she says the other yeah .
he answered ca n't <unk> me .
here we have the level mandated .
the first text is a little <unk> that i first time i wrote that i went back .
i see , it was a person 's devoted to me and what does .
it carries the title <unk> .
and it at yourself does n't understand .
when your head in my lap we slept under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg , she was under my ceiling with your leg will lay out of the ceiling .
my leg that we look for the ceiling .
it 's about her head is wait on my lap dear , the rest of her camping under the ceiling , my leg , under the ceiling , her leg out of the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg got extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text and i also at a person 's a conference , i 'm very much does .
and that is my grandpa owned .
we 've ever since no contact with respectability anymore .
my <unk> grandfather was from a butcher paper .
so , as a child 's refusal to love making it .
this has to me just , yes .
yes , 'n text .
better be the idea .
jesus is the only their savior is on the sticker , the glass of the bus .
but where jesus was when he took me , and on this sticker <unk> , saving to ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
so text .
the text is a little bit more .
he takes a half hours .
so to write .
read it faster .
's the beginning of a novel , who i degrees in the <unk> write .
ah , it goes to <unk> guys , the adventure , from a guy that again , the hairs about them and a little too much to <unk> .
i <unk> , let me , and again , this point of the book i distance .
because i want to see , i 'd never seen the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head empty .
so who looks like the sheet that he now to fill it .
and i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't .
i do , let me find ourselves too hard .
and it 's the , i play , like with my for discussing and my language .
i see , always been to me .
and then get you know , these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is probably the <unk> <unk> that i ever been writing .
<unk> we can .
we dosage .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , that 's putting yourself also did n't understand .
no idea .
you clap of me .
i say , always , either of divinity or no .
the next sheet has also do with text .
it 's obvious that 's a little <unk> .
i ' that time for the insects and writing .
very polite .
yes , 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and that is about how cool , if i do that their three to say you might be .
my text is the title , all good things are really cool .

<unk> we must <unk> .
so to cuddle this , <unk> , <unk> and from scratch and then it 's the better and this is it .
at achieving a moment .
yes , 'n <unk> , this is this time , the other .
and that is about how cool , if i 'll see , that we all a kind of <unk> could make them , so 'n try to that all time .
right , so that what the wind power .
the text is the title <unk> and about this .
yes .
it 's fun to you guys .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write , so like little <unk> .
this is a hidden sexual pun .
sexual desire to <unk> 's written .
with the s ?
yes .
it 's fun to you guys .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
is a very long last sentence .

here 's still a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already know , before i it as such <unk> i .
he taught me , labor of going to explore , and then they would he told me <unk> .
i could do to me later still in him <unk> .
i told him the joy done .
it as <unk> ago all other days found out and me back to sleep laid down .
with a <unk> grin as the face where else ?
and purpose , it , i do n't want to honor the notion that i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it can do n't need to a going day traded .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what she said to albert einstein , when he would be a steak medium does n't she liked ?
i q .
so .
letter q sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
the text which has also the paper her learned .
this is more what political .
so i write , not just fun things .
i write , let 's also partially a lot of .
and it 'll see , i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , yeah , i ' i that text is written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my father came from vienna , in my mother and i from her .
yes .
we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes the way , this is to see , i 'd like a little do ads .
i ca n't business or so afford , so i must always the <unk> do .

can look like a show up .
and i <unk> ' , i <unk> , actually very likable .
and , yes .
this to see , i just have said .
it goes on in the program .
more apps .
this is a little advertising , i let 's written .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin toe .
before , very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your friend -- writing , but the punch it was just pretty flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you know , that 's listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
now , i want to the same with a <unk> question is start .
why do you <unk> actually do ?
i thought everybody , the tax man used to be wondering , whether it at least some potentially the society which goes back .
the answer is clear .
we know now that the life , at the birth just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
it 's subject to the environmental impacts , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why do we still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> of messages from <unk> , who , part of each other on ?
they all remember , in fifteen years to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought , , you look fat from the food we see , to all have time , and yogurt being old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves with different <unk> in american way has led and what do n't touch it has changed that the americans every year 's become inconsequential .
then , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
so it 's going , a new <unk> sow and it all the village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now the reason is for my taste , part at that we go through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal cases , in terms of wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> alone is here .
the by you know about all .
<unk> published a lot widely magazine a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , seven years , in the number one on it .
then she died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one human beings , proven to the on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people , say , they are six , but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and it stopped with <unk> on to smoke started but with <unk> again , and then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not that smoking are healthy .
but it tells us that we age very complicated is , and that we -- i need to be simple experimental media systems and we need to just might ask questions .
a very simple question and a very simple issue that the different countries , man 's women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
this is the testosterone , the <unk> to the male <unk> is produced .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for animals , to think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it , but also been a good tips , not afraid .
we should we 've got correlation , very much to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy , as usual <unk> to illustrate .
there 's visiting so somebody a <unk> grandma , and asks , we have them because so different done or another way that ate that it old to become are ?
ah .
that she has every day , tens of cigarettes all these guys .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?


even when statistics are n't always potent .
for instance , there ai n't very hard that shows that people , <unk> in the landscapes to get older , as humans , do n't do it .
do .
it would .
is that from the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it is that the people just enough money in the pocket have to think , to her age and the <unk> diseases to take care .
but if i had a group of animals a <unk> to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent live longer than a group received the <unk> because it 's not get but otherwise , the same way that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and actually are these attempts have been done .
to tell you , <unk> is very -- what but even when i do with my enemies deal here am is that regular fast during the life going up .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here 's a <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , the <unk> line showing then life that were much longer .
it 's the same for <unk> , their worms into a mouse and recently , now , about two years in the u.s. is that , it even for the monkey is on .
and it 's not about that thin .

and that 's a another experiment , in the united states .
what , did here ?
you have a <unk> and has one of this so-called <unk> given , a <unk> diet , so as many <unk> this day and night , anyway .
and who to wonder about it , mice are being dick became , sick and have a , <unk> and a bad <unk> .
now , a parallel <unk> and that has exactly the same number of the <unk> looking at the only that in a break .
the have the day , no food to , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
despite having both animals <unk> feed itself .
both have a lot eaten .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it 's a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
, when you organisms , cells replicating food taken away from then she catches the organism on , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds needed them to use it again energy .
that makes sense .
and it 's like this .
you can see , in the cell really , <unk> are mainly to junk , the ages <unk> .
the merged , with the stomach that 's going to <unk> and the cell as energy back to the challenge .
it 'll leave you damage that the age accumulate in the limit given .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , it 's so regular touch is going up the different organisms .
and it 's likely to know that 's also in people work .
and we learn that it 's not like <unk> recommended every small <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should , if you 're hungry , , ah , maybe this is under the <unk> on .
welcome them their hunger strike like a friend .
and it 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of the history has the person , what did , when it 's what did ?
right , he is they 'll be gone .
we go out of the fridge hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is readily , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looking for us very different from .
here , of ariana <unk> in a medieval paradise being shown .

and that 's kind of the real <unk> .
we 've been so in search for all done , the molecular answer the <unk> turn though the organism is eating .
it could get to be interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might be a congregation of the hardest <unk> of life from .
the question is that we can <unk> , <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , of the thousands of all scans , natural substances .
we 've actually , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all those organisms that naturally does the but also in all these organisms during the halt even less will .
in the skin it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells for example , and then you see this .
this is a is cell division here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see how many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very just look .
and it works in different organisms .
for instance , here shown on a <unk> .
so we have a substance found that the molecular <unk> lightbulb the <unk> .
life because the organisms that , no longer .
and the answer is again , yes , you see here 's a typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , for days is about half the dead .
you know , when we <unk> the water to this actually be the animals grow and surviving better .

and the latest research on , too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> up going .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now they want to say , all know where is <unk> ago ?
how the name , it 's the sperm being discovered nearly there 's what 's very high concentrations .
but i can they did , in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> soybeans are , in japan , <unk> afforded , this is called <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we 've then , when <unk> against <unk> help the way it 's the junk <unk> it do then might also to <unk> ?
they have to which is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we 've actually , we got to be done .
they 're going to wonder , we have an object of flies have done .
flies to see , you had , if you to age .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms , for memory of these are very much like the people .
now , you 're still , how to the devil has the guy the memory of flies have measured it ?
this is the experiment , we share with stefan seals from the university in berlin .
you take a hundred flies and put that 's a bit of which one another , they love .
<unk> .

then they take the same way to give you call the chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , the you love , which is <unk> .
and we make it the <unk> enjoy , but you ai <unk> <unk> .
in classic <unk> .
then take it back on the same way to do the here in .
the driving this degree in your down , because you see the .
and if you down here there are going to give them from the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> this .
where do that all need to go ?
right .
the cherry cola .
except the two here .
these are the <unk> .
or say they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , i do n't get through this ai <unk> reward , corrupt .
okay .
but it 's a form of character , with the age increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain came that were , were back the ground .
that means <unk> does n't just to stop aging , but to <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important , because we want to be honest , the <unk> not the lifespan , per se extend .
there 's no point , in the time <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't putting them , without them , a few practical tips to give you 're that we have a younger .
it harder , <unk> fast .
it 's not that you gain weight on or so .
there 's by now in austria as a group of <unk> people , a day of eating and one day n't eat .

and the the very good pilot .
that means that it 's <unk> .
that they <unk> .
it 's not to carbs complex carbs do n't even dangerous . .
it 's really matter of candy .
you know now that <unk> sufficiently 're going to get diabetes in their own , even then when they got sleek .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors , if it can .
here you ai <unk> , on , the ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose to get out .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all of organisms that .
you eat regular fruits and vegetables .
one carve them the gift of a <unk> or from <unk> at all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer of course .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter a <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin is building .
some that you look at least three times per week a half hour of sports , this is completely trivial .
cigarettes , despite the original <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you , it was in the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
so the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life is to back .
because the monks lives almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life , still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> to be used as <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what with some really all to do .
, we do , we do this is very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then our ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what 's like that 's probably in her around .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so , by drinking under conditions there <unk> .
why has no alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
an integral to partner , or a family is , longevity human .
they should n't on a lot busiest streets live .
now think it right <unk> .
this has , but with <unk> n't have to do .

you can measure the closer somebody on a lot busiest streets have that , the more <unk> he has been in the blood .
and it as if he says , i was they were used .
i can already well sleep and the sound and i do n't mind .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
sun would anyone could be because <unk> course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
moreover , it can make the <unk> down .
and we also know that i guess onions and <unk> mice , diseases protect .
knew that by our grandmothers already also the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it may not without any sense .
many studies show that dark chocolate , by dementia <unk> work .
just recently is a study with , shown that a half the board got dark chocolate a day the <unk> of <unk> on the level of <unk> can make .
like what you of coffee there 's the most sober , you 're now thinner .
there 's trials , that show , there 's trials , that does n't show .
what it is that coffee against juvenile diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .

a very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people fifteen years , they were have shown that people every day a handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for a <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , who , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the botanically in fact , beans .
the be some of the notion that they engaging together to call , okay ?
that are , but it 's beans .
so for the peanuts so is not .
the next thing is a little bit dodgy .
one carve them the tape of of animal protein , of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
a very beautiful new study shows that if you this time of animal protein to do to take you <unk> so strong increase if you took a strong smokers , be .
this is not for the time after the animal protein are good and it 's true of course not , faster-growing children or at the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and this , it will want .
we do you <unk> .

everything <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he goes 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> as not an anecdote but it lives in a <unk> , particularly of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed , i do you today i 've gone .
we should look at all the <unk> way it ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
which is that <unk> of a halt i 've not a biological limits but a social seems to be , and so , a -- who have .
you <unk> the less people to and that could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece in contemporary critics , the adolescents have fresh <unk> .
i thank you very much .
i want to start with a question , i do you realize it .
a question , so nobody wants to step up , because it 's a bit of avalokitesvara , which of you 's kinda lonely process ?
the output 's very low .
one are still as i thought .
it , but probably reasons that be no who have , the people that for instance , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse solitude and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
this is not liking that the case .
'll see from loneliness is actually a shallow phenomenon of people than just straightforward .
maybe it 's also that you to do n't who have , because the question here 's a matter .
like to be lonely process or is you very lonely ?
you can , lonely feel , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely be no , the moment the lonely having to feel .
one has also a lot of shame .
and that 's some now here from have to loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is in shame and realize that in one .
one takes time .
and therefore the left is now here 's no one who have in the few seconds , which i do you 've never have .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to do it , their own , even aware .
and loneliness is also need training exercise to talk about .
and this exercise has we all into action .
we have neither the language , we have any sign of we ourselves to recognize when we are lonely process ?
there 's the one two <unk> , which i tried and once in am .
the one part of the says that 's from beginning of lonely .
of the birth to death is actually you just kinda lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> .
these people go and often to <unk> and drive , the whole day .
i ' danzón no time , is her <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , everything is with all connected .
that i think there 's not actually , i is just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also one of the time that time i think like this .
the i think , okay , today , i 'm feeling lonely and the next day , it depends , all together .
if we , it’s loneliness to think of us , first of the very big one of a .
the one of dying , one of the person on an icu .
but about these <unk> , about this big <unk> <unk> , today i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the everyday <unk> , and loneliness to us , as a theater going to meet .
i want to do n't talk about a burden and <unk> the <unk> .
and loneliness is in other things of us , not difficult one of us to <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , has the break a few pictures made , i want to show you .
how easy it 's always falls down , and loneliness to discover .
and we know everybody does n't , whether these people know , this moment , lonely she felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> of where you think , all talking together , you , is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know quite sure that 's all .
may have some they also now been seen .
what you about it does you put that your appendix out very often , that could you today , very good at this is doing that <unk> on the mobile also an escape the brink of solitude .
and visible , you look at the phone 's look .
what we now this is n't do .
and then there 's the one , types of them , is the one of <unk> on <unk> stage hundreds of <unk> faces , and even something left in the hope that you to their text would n't forget .
these are the <unk> , you from without looking .
that we need to people to it .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , birth of lonely having merely feeling of their entire life for this is sitting have the notion that they have tried to this one of the <unk> to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed price , the people are feeling lonely , because they 're going on a different people up to be it because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it also not something that still so many people also people , where they 're connected to hang around them are you feel , lonely .
and there 's people , have the relevant to yourself , lost to do n't touch with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you look at the analog loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who are going to your mind , there 's no , social contact .
again , it 's always had relative .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human contact with when do n't .
we cut down there , the old people a .
it 's the analog teaching of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities certainly connected with very many people at facebook , or twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger .
you can start with hundreds of people connected to be without working with a single human right to measure .
it 's in the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , lacking is it in the digital loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often over <unk> .
this is also that the analog loneliness is a little grew in .
whereas the digital loneliness to think , suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of data point that the digital loneliness to the future , you may gain is when the possibilities , to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know that in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similarly , it 's more loneliness to call it .
or whether you for then a new word that we can find .
but that are also kind of problems of the successional generation .
almost , the , and loneliness itself is the fear , and loneliness and from that are afraid of the one are people have a lot to do n't ready .
<unk> , big <unk> , a <unk> man has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in which describes what people to do everything to not alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , then again are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear , and loneliness to kick out , which is spending money .
shop to go .
that 's favor .
both the process over , the one , because it at the short run a contact in such as the items that you 've been acquired by .
only problem is that 's very close to help and holding , this kind of those potions for the one .
so we need to , new things buy us to <unk> .
i ' time the advertising for a a <unk> panties label seen .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications with the catchphrase that be doing a lot of it .
what that in our to do you know that 's not , but it works , it .
one has so nothing with some of solitude to do one finds of people just instead .
<unk> <unk> has now that 's a poem written and there is a verse , the worst is that it’s loneliness to second .
hand on it all the heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be waking up , or the other people , while to see and , terrible thing is how to feel , terrible lonely having to feel and to ask the question , who 's this man 's really ?
i ' i want to do something to do ?
one saying that the are women around the world , with kids , feel .
of gaps missing , because i 'd already , i wo n't know , if i the study found myself , and they have so often have , i they told .

that intuitive way that completely obvious thing is it 's almost a <unk> .
and loneliness to second is any given too familiar and yet we do n't talk about them .
so just bit about the one of the sex .
this is also has probably already has experienced .
now , while you <unk> is , to think , we do , i 'm here 's really ?
who is this person in my bed , to be ?
this is also a from loneliness that 's not what to have to deal with the quality of sexual about .
and nothing to do have to deal with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we speak only do , not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one , <unk> when we think .
i was recently , so <unk> <unk> and i noticed a group of five <unk> , i said , three people carrying suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have to talk , two women in a costume designers have to be entertained .
and in which said something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in my hand , an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene do n't turn out on so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also , his workforce actually has experienced again <unk> .
it 's the one of <unk> .
but it 's also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see in this may also some of their lives in motor cortex , <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> in the hotels , generic bars that often as well , i wo n't know , who they 're actually , they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
again , it 's a from loneliness to think about the n't talked to .
only it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> be abused .
down here is , installing insulation .
i have a <unk> that he 'd been from a client , which has said , it is , then happened , you can get it 's not making you imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he even contributes to <unk> would be released .
and two months later he 's also on .
the one never comes out by that .
it 's always in conjunction with other feelings .
it 's nice siblings and it 's ugly siblings .
the siblings , we 've all .
fear , sadness in despair anger and the shame .
but we should also the good 's not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea take , the one .
and come and goes in life as calling tide detergent and floods occur .
let them to and let be no , picking up .
because there 's still a lot worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that might be produced , and loneliness is if you do n't know , there .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one thought i know , they have to me two things change .
for one in my friends the <unk> i do n't even more like a autocratic dictator since i realized i realized that i only then always somebody to call out , why he proved to do n't raise because i was thinking maybe i 'm losing the people , and i 'll see , i lonely .
i think it 's been able , since i the one in my life and i people come and go to them .
what it 's the which that you do .
and there i can become .
people come and go to let them , it immediately to millions and , whether , from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership to what could .
as a child , i found my parents an embarrassing .
the can look at any <unk> by without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the <unk> or the economy .
every time led to get it an average .
as a child , i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , it for <unk> that 's to this openness .
but first since i even so the loneliness to work with you get it me at least , and again me , which is supposed to open .
you see it 's kinda lonely be called , ready to do for the next artistic performance .
thank you .
thank you .
i see , here three bills in .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now ask , i do you what if it 's look into one which it would you take ?
most of you hire the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort in the effect in .
in health , we do it 's sort of different .
because we let the activity with the largest negative effect disappears completely other than eight and make us for other strategy .
we make us for example of the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not quite valuable .
or we make us for the <unk> .
the is for food .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not quite valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the least of effort in the biggest <unk> achieve .
if you , prevention and health with that comes to a subject does n't you do .
and the issue is overweight .
and this topic either overweight was in germany long time , no issue , so , until the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany , where
and i asked me , there was going on the <unk> ?
why did the way that soar all of a top ?
and then i research and i 'm <unk> .
because it was right in years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we are over and bigger ?
and i keep on .
<unk> comes for , germany .
and that obesity is .
and the years 20,000 take the curve , right , more rapid .
and what comes , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how do all that means .
and we are over and bigger ?
well , i was one and one of all .
because it was yes .
sports is thick .
and of stuck , i 'm not here today , to tell you do , the sport 's power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've now let 's all of aid .
the tide of the new art training -- and <unk> has not to run by that we 're looking and be healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the atkins diet ?
and also there 's a very good study from the united states .
and the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to do , we look , so what happens is really ?
and they 've seen , people , in fact , and less fat , but the people , and fewer calories to be but nevertheless , always getting bigger .
and this was a paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can explain that ?
there must be the body as a power of the way .
because we have here as a big <unk> .
and on the one is a <unk> , do we all the coals on , be here you .
and this is where the energy handcuffed , when electricity .
if we now , more coals on here in there in our power than we 're going on the other areas of <unk> at the kind of the power and it took off .
the human body does n't equate to bang .
the can see the energy to store .
and it in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here 's the energy , both wobbling it just one thing to .
the <unk> , increases dramatically reduce .
here 's actually not alive anymore .
we 're yes , mobile .
and what happened .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to a fluke .
and we come today has been even on a to two miles and are the positive estimates .
there 's trials , which of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that still a <unk> with my friend mike tell .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
it 's too shy , it 's not going to talk too much .
and he was back in this trial and sitting now .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> , and jeans <unk> <unk> and it has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike eat and fewer puzzles , and fewer and it , <unk> , and yet it will get over and bigger .
why ?
because mike , sitting .
and i first time i watched , how much more movement that mike gets so the day , and i blew his time as a step back in the pocket and who and night , again <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
this was so the distance , mike at has in the kitchen to the car with the car into the office there course of a coffee , and recycling at the back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was that day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of myself .
and mike 's not so , because he too much to eat because as long as it up again , energy <unk> , but not used it will inevitably must always getting bigger and the energy <unk> .
and first <unk> the energy , as you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , is not there .
the <unk> , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and also because it 's active and <unk> quiet and quiet in his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if the energy <unk> the blood , talking about the physicians of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> there , who , it 's all this little black holes in this <unk> .
and a lucky now floating , there are still at the big fat around and that up , about these little nasty wounds and we speak of <unk> or atherosclerosis .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it has to the blood flowing through these tight <unk> pots and pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high then on this is a <unk> true , then it in the body breaks off .
and when that the heart happens , then we call the heart attack .
and when that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second , heart and stroke .
that go in germany and dies every second , <unk> .
and mike 's so not so sick , because he did n't got to my but because he proved to do n't actually more than moving .
and if you have this do n't know , for you always on in the wrong .
so for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , caloric-restriction diet , and you 're looking into and there are these cost <unk> <unk> <unk> , until now .
and if each book , a centimeter is thick and we were the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy in so more food as they consume and you 'll thick .
and if you less energy in fact , when they use then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to cost about books ?
it is just one thing to .
the need is obviously there but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why have failure of diet , a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet and she is not a lifestyle .
what we 've come to the things , we here 's three weeks , and here 's five weeks , we tend to this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our normal life around .
what we then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .

so you get to small , today at each new diet , each new <unk> questions , and they want that their day-to-day , your lifestyle into .
yes or no ?
and if we did , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end n't turn out , it is that time .
it are the habits that 's happened to decide whether we 're sick , or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , we 're sick .
and it are the good behavior of us healthy .
and if mike looks in the mirror and he looks like , the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike looks in the mirror , it looks like there are and daily habits .
and if mike looks in the mirror and to be honest , is then he looks as well , where it 's the way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good bread , then it 's just showed me into the disease in the way .
and if mike in the way to the long-term health direction of its goals , direction of its dreams , there must n't he said , all his life to change .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a , and talking about behavior . mike 's also a great example of that the person has been a weird animal is .
mike 's for example , managed movement has completely out of his life <unk> by it every way with the car , every an advantage , the use .
and night and he was crying on the couch and to sort of knots , movement .
so is he , his <unk> is the gym where the casualness with an escalator , up what yes , per se , it 's and will then how much as a rat in the back as a band <unk> so that he somehow got back to movement from .
and my grandpa did that , just any as you .
the was a farmer and the would that do n't understand .
the have said , sports is for people , you know , not move .
and somehow he has also pretty much .
why we need to night in our very precious leisure technology , that effectively compensate for what we the ground forgot to have ?
being taken as we have today with this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
and about , much easier to the back there to find where we they lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i want you today to a perspective invite you .
may also know you the situation that drives the evening , quickly go shopping to and following afternoon , that in the front row — no way for free .
and that you look like , so this <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because of go .
we plan our homes so that we <unk> ways .
we plan our entire life that we <unk> ways , but that brings us , not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so you get to do today the <unk> activate and the back there are finding where they 've been up .
i drive down , like to participate in the track .
and i 'm the only the always waking up and down and up and down on and everybody else .
but if i mean , before , there 's me , then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement that 's just like this around .
and if , the announcement here is , 30 minutes <unk> , tell you see , i hooray .
these cost steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and a , and talking about these cost at if you do today , every day these cost steps more and then that mean that you for the day 12 , gram of fat not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of the century , <unk> days , then we talk from four point five kilogram of fat .
that we do not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are yes crazy , put so here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are one , i four pounds .
just so you would , and i can see what happened there with these little baby steps .
and when that the effect is coming from this perspective , you mean , just happened , if you really an active life on .
and these <unk> the , they 're small , today , every day in their day-to-day .
once you look at <unk> steps per day there are , walk you virtually all the so-called lifestyle .
and if you got tired and have time in sports and then they doing it on top .
then you have to the <unk> , <unk> .
and you 'll also still evolving faster and stronger .
but so you your health , it on what kind of sport .
so you your health , it on , their own got tired and of their time .
because the most the most important that they doing now every day as much .
and i <unk> , an active life around <unk> .
and to me is it has more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a lives that on a clear that decision based on for the life and for me .
so i believe , health has not to do with me , we should do or do have .
but health has to do with me , we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now , an idea for them .
they decide , today just , for the best .
and protocell ab now you can also how can .
step at a .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo that leonardo da vinci , to be done on this incredible , you see way of the world with others have to see ?
and their own , so far on that engage , to his time just simply inconceivable , never thought was
we could have that also now ?
that , maybe what with companies to do ?
and how we can make this force and confidence to our future draw ?
we start , there , with the question what do we actually sort of innovation ?
right .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the government .
now , do me right .
this is yes , it 's great .
and we can start with fairly be proud of it and be grateful that we <unk> in that you fields are that our technologies around the world , it would be that it 's good to go .
that we do with a this extraordinary , unique new wealth .
but what 's the future from ?
the challenges that come because when society , to us ?
and who cares , because the large environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> , it that somehow that .
a kind of labor .
so the economy of the environmental challenges that 's because the entrepreneurs , big effort with the then we had productivity and efficiency .
and the the world better do want to find , nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens ' and they have to actually , what are so we 're going to be into government of course , then the damage the inner capitalist 's economy to really .
at least to form to fix .
but who says , because that we all than that are separated at to ?
how about it because if we <unk> to a social and cultural dimension to expand this ?
if technological innovation of the same time , cultural innovation are ?
if economic vitality out of the same time , social innovation are ?
if it 's able to become leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different way they have no knowledge of forces <unk> and if it 's even a very different , fair <unk> to promote positive ?
because what was that ?
both sides to but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
, we might ask a woman .
so far we do this is yes , as a way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh catching on a lot on the federal poverty and <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just to the direct <unk> to the , the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as an entrepreneur , i was for the nobel prize <unk> .
in the opportunity because it strikes me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i think andré <unk> .
'n very subtle distinction of young guy .
that 's trained , but also its ideal from capsizing .
and yes , totally <unk> .
i like the , like .
and if you do the see , you think oh boy , and this young , because we need to us to our future , yes not about .
yes , right after the school , he then there 's begun to work in one in our <unk> hidden champions .
that 's he also very good .
that they took him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something which is there are still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that the entrepreneurial he says then always .
companies are yes , all <unk> .
and that they took him .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's the <unk> , which i did he is just get detected .
so not that he asked him for us know , but this is the <unk> tell him the table , what .
and the in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , the more , he was surprised when the and then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , he then there are introduced .
the janitor 's great pleasure and years , with young people together , and his experience to share .
and the two , enjoy each other .
and have , more often hit .
how about it because if we , so in a lot of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes . <unk> , like this was because again .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by companies ?
that i still not quite understand .
so andré then we start , mate , in the question what 's 'n <unk> companies ?
so name says , do n't know , .
they were creating markets , they were creating products , established business customers , they were structures , there 's a history .
and you can also pretty much what 's the ab give , where the large figures just go .
and so what it ai n't a <unk> , the very neat is that it also .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so andré , you <unk> , so one is it 's n't guarantee it is not the small copy of a company .
it 's something very different .
it turns out , a radically different character .
because it , wait until nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's a <unk> a little bit like an organization that the purpose is a business to look , to develop the profitable outcome is that , but , would is , and then they scale it .
and you 're certainly understand that it course , so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
this is me , right .
but after what we look for because actually ?
so i <unk> ' time , then goes , do n't know , because you can <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i see , there , degrees , that fits quite well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin once you want to me that recommendation here ?
that is <unk> .
how you sidestepped your business to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> your life , <unk> have .
oh no .
now , it <unk> ?
what you think because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> have the money which is because we keep your <unk> ?
so start you a career as passive <unk> or ?
what if you do with your commitment , as i know you ?
and we look , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you 're not quite confident perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years , then in a lot worse financial situation ago when your great shoes .
money is always the result of a successful company and of a good at it enterprise .
their money is an energy for an enterprise actions .
and it 's the basis of all economic <unk> .
but it 's never be the end of a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so if i what they do , i see , but learned , without the goal is no way of the right .
and targets should be familiar , and then and measurable in time certainly be , etc .
and when i do all that 's not have ' , that as i can for something of the i did n't know what i was supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , decide , and risk because it feels , for me all this somewhat vague , uncertain .
andré welcome the enterprise .
but i see , because maybe what for you .
one thread .
so the is , <unk> , you , secret .
successful <unk> of to <unk> .
a <unk> for business .
so , or how does tell you today ?
<unk> think , i , <unk> ?
so we tell you know , always <unk> this .
in for all the crises and seizures and seizures sustainable uncertainty .
so it guarantees peace .
i think ' , i can you one of them to leave .
okay .
thank you , mister <unk> .
but there are , these questions on .
that can you the same time when one of the enterprise qualities is good and ask questions .
we can see the time one after the other things go to the may understand better ?
so the first one is what i here and what i want to do this happen ?
andré , because it 's <unk> what moves you that 's about you beyond that 's bigger than you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of you with you work ?
what you ready to be ?
what are your inner solar cells , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why does this important that to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of learned ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together parts of a hot you of wood , but by teaching people yearning for the roots of , an ocean .
well .
so then i look at me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that ?
andré now think you can your goal really time i could color .
actually could color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you 'll know , if you <unk> , you do n't want to then it , you 're going .
you know , the story with the pink , elephant ?
it strikes me there is a .
not ?
ne square .
so , along , .
reset you know , no turning pink elephants .
okay ?
it works , right ?
so no turning pink elephants .
me ?
no turning pink elephants .
you see ?
so it 's us , if you so on them focus on this , we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , you that ago , you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas are on the <unk> .
but yes , you very sort of years ago .
the way , i just to you like , <unk> right ?
i see , you know , a brought .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> serious .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time that that <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , .
and i do <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> custody lady smith .



it 's has answered a matter of <unk> .

and andré what 's from ?
you what noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower .
okay .
so , we 're looking down there , then , let 's where the bear with .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> serious .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time that that <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , .
and i do <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> custody lady smith .
and andré , how 's you that ?
so i still , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time that i went back .
i thought it can be honest , probably not was eradicated .
and , a lot more shocking , i was as me through the head into is it could be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i understand that , this is yes , meaning .

but it 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was born and <unk> ' i from ?
and so andré to realize you your perception up anywhere <unk> to have , is a more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get there , to the next question .
how i could actually to my get where ?
so that i find a good question .
that 's like , i mean , every time , and do somehow not going forward .
andré , there 's a good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you may have known as you .
because if you your care of what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n in the very sort of presented to have i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost as a machine .
you 're going to do n't you can be able to a brainstorming is in you is that things , you to .
that are then these famous <unk> , you in the shower have .
and still a question i 'm going to tell you , to look at you good to , who you have could who you to take an interesting questions could talk to go and more input , more knowledge-based view , of mind to get .
and you 've also a model .
the grand duke cosimo have the great brings .

for lunch at the famous big table .
and that is totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , a banker , as engineers , architects and he has a very intense <unk> clean .
but not in this sense , where 's drum went , who down , through ?
who 's right ?
but is more likely to do that of these different <unk> things that are the way , no way of one of which you 'll have to come up .
well , the next question is what 's next step i do ?
andré there are doing , it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of debt to anticipate and management and so what you , just on the next step .
because you because in terms of uncertainty , do ?
but the lead this really determined and all the consequence out .
and if there 's , and then there was `` dan 's supposed to ask you know , <unk> one step .
and even when the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's wait a different .
so it 's as important that you sidestepped your what 's clear .
that you the security .
and the way as we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes would n't know , and it 's nobody has said ?
-- she says , and number of children .
so this playful , to do this and cultivate this <unk> playful attempt for it 's also , this is fun that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of the antidote to the uncertainty , otherwise , are anxious .
thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , 's awesome .
but i 'm not at me in the company , i think , there to stand still a lot of bosses who do that there anything happens .
and myself so here in germany wants there is , these general ; mood .
and i think ' , there have the politicians , once that make that , changes .
okay my boy , come on time with .
how do here 's go down the water .
what you think of how many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look at here comes down .
if you see ?
right , the .
this is the you change can the you really change can .
or to 's down mahatma gandhi to say for the change , you level of looking in you yourself .
you think i think beautiful words and huge role models , but what is this because it work ?
because we have , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to small share with for something or if you a collapsing feel and they have all with you to do .
and if you in of these situations they 're probably wondering what i 'm saying , now despite all this ; ask , you , which is what you take can happen to you really powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , but what you to them like , the time , you 're <unk> .
and , finally , like , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because it .
so i mean , if it you already happening is , it at had paid .
yeah well .
mr . <unk> thank you .
and you believe that to me that 's going on my enterprise way ?
yes .
and realize you , two things .
first time on the clarity of your inner <unk> that then to your enterprise what will .
because that determines your perception .
and the second one on your inner attitude to myself to face .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future is , then when we put our own perception .
<unk> you that to ?
i think , let 's already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good andré <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our andré ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
clear .
which i , is the spirit can see .
<unk> means then breathe controversy .
and that is what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from some potions for the euphoria .
and no , new <unk> , actually ne square .
now there 's the <unk> .
the right now this country , long time in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert , bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin or <unk> or how they all these hot .
let us , just that spirit to revivify it .
and who knows what you will be honest , from our andré the next leonardo in our time .
you see right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would so intuitive to me to me with kids and their future of thing because finally we 're honest , children the future .
instead , this is the way , i of the time enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in jail .
four years ago , my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for prisoners , created .
we could qualify <unk> captures that means , you can control for the prison either on making or find after their was lighter one in the they actually , can hold .
why do care i so now , so happened to <unk> , the ones who have failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is far , not easy to understand how programs that , to kids do .
and frankly , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , i work would .
what you think that 's the most of defining factor in childhood up with the people that we work with ?
we figure out , it are positive models of this positive models .
and if you think about why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and many <unk> there are often is it 's that the father had no sensible work has that he 's a bug -- that he drugs which or that he asked ourselves in prison is .
and when a when he , think about what it from his life to do , he may not better idea , as a different lives might look because he was no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you martin imagine .

his father was raging alcoholic and the entire family life this the hell .
when he was 12 , is his mother died , and he and his little baby brother who had the home .
there it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and the perfect victims .
to the day as his little baby brother , in a game so roughly <unk> been doing is that the ground are stuck .
there out , martin 's the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , and there have to .
and do that day , it respects .
and it went off .
violence was part of well , to his life that 's the same his father .
how it goes well , who , i just described -- i went to continue ?
after the late childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> spaces .
and you 're going to one day with people in prison , i 'd like that 's exactly is about their thoughts about the same community over the also not a better models are .
about what , believe you think these people together , , you can put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level and plan , in the prison where they produced , in prison <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will everybody had second thing you go back .
then there 's but also people in prison , really change want .
but also these people wear a rubber stamps in the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where it is that your first building identity .
if you make a work for , if you make a place for whether you a private installers will build a relationship to all going to you with that identity , with this to face , you one of others in the society that infinite hard power .
this is that , , we are .
how we 're trying to handle this issue ?
what they have this , believe they get many <unk> with ?
you will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> 's built up there 's definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
only the subject of risk management course , she 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison that space .
these characteristics we want to a good use .

we need to the basics of entrepreneurship and economics .
everyone to write its own business and everyone to take on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then with me to the people , and also in the custody at the <unk> , and i do <unk> in the strengthening of your personal relations and also in one of <unk> .
what a big go there from our program did ?
it 's a range , from <unk> the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a very high range and to do <unk> ' i want to tell you naíma imagine .
<unk> leaders , talent and the illusion of the tea is money , it 's very early to trade with their seduces us .
he had always been fun doing it , businesses to run .
he 's then <unk> the first time getting arrested .
and those later it 's not very impressed me .
all the contrary .
he says sound -- now , he would have at its second custody for me .
<unk> is he then the second time been wrongfully convicted .
and he then only thing about the therapy part and then the <unk> .
and he did , he used to become leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> created .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
it , very good checks papers .
he 's now here with me .
who hears him to know them to talk about it .
it harder , back to martin that i told him at the story .
martin 's got to his childhood an education , chef of purpose and ended up in his play in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and they go up there on the agenda are was being that is quite quickly started .
he worked with a dj decks and as a security guard .
twenty years , which he took this life .
and he says , that he was upset with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day that he someone at a <unk> so hard that he then was convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , he , and more force to more success and more life index coming to live without his fists together to make juice or no drugs to consume .
and he was from his prize — so excited that he had decided that would he likes to pass .
and he wanted to become part of the <unk> .
that has worked .
he works for now , two years at us and <unk> to give her on a path toward the freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools with the hand get that much more is possible as often do what i want .
the basis of these successes are by humans as you .
people , with us to prison , the to of events , with us to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to write it .
that are our position , <unk> talks in our lessons really think that are students at the <unk> <unk> the business plans to make .
and that are our mentors , people want to right after the prison with me .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our shows an exercise , <unk> called .
we 're pasting , in the center of the room a big so people want to stand on the one and our an stand on the other .
and i 'm going to then of questions .
and every time , if someone in space that question `` yes , we might answer is he is to the line .
and here shows , that we all have , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one example of this , where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm in a call social focal point up , or i was a family refusing to us , in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and very few of our an environment .
a question , i 'd like to now , we all together , <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
and i urge you that they all of even get up .
maybe we can be a little light to get in the audience .
i can see you .
there 's all .
well .
thank you .
i get out , you now a question , and if you that question `` yes , answering put them , again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's kind of our our line , we now .
i have in my life of getting done things , for the i may be able to was it 's not .
if you that question `` yes , answering put them , please .
to count , drunk car .
to count , maybe too low doses of marijuana or obsessed .
to count that 's the seat , we do , .
okay .
and it 's also might have any workforce that 's not always show it correctly for .
it .
most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they have to other , back down .
in this question , when we have the events to get our an environment very often try to me thinking .
and you will also clear , how much greater happiness you may have had .
happiness with the parents ' happiness with the environment in they grew up , with the friends , but also very fortunate that you may not always with those caught flat-footed again , are you do something that 's by the <unk> , and beyond that did .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni of finding 'em from within <unk> days after their was a work .
this is very quickly .
nineteen percent , they have already is done .
third of the donors are in the last year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent to face .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> a year , taxpayers thirty dollars .
and it 's a <unk> , -- to a <unk> of seven percent to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a massive saving local means .
when my father and i do that <unk> started have , we are anti-everything , putting away from pretty much for quite nuts and that was .
i whistled at my great <unk> in a big businesses comes up .
but i want to tell you , i whistled in my life , not a <unk> work .
we encourage people want to have to take .
the responsibility to your life 's happened , and most responsible for to wrestle , in their lives will happen .
now , not to hide , nothing to whitewash .
because it leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , faith to build .
and therefore it makes me , especially happy and proud when people want to open source of their way to report .
now i showed you a little video with them .
so fictitious .
so i was convicted of two years and eight months of dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years and 10 months , convicted .
i do with the marijuana traded .
so i judgment of two years , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> , also made .
because there was my my absolute huge .
i was n't <unk> , to see , i almost as well yeah .
i tripped on the goals , and tip .
i tripped on the way discovered i went back to jump forward on .
and goes with a very different awareness and consciousness from the prison out .
so far the more and <unk> without a fixed set targets and then is you know , in and something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that 's not anymore .
well , that is that many no health , when the emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then is a split some that you go back in the old track it .
you know that , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual coaching , whatever , there 's all being offered is , at me just my whole think about giving me remind ourselves about other , above the of problems , above the of the society , the world , at me just during these two weeks completely around .
i 've been <unk> . my first woman in divorce .
and since time after six months good bye '' i went back with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i had one of , through this whole <unk> and many other things change i went back .
so much i ' i already done .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today i was quitting , to see , i say .
i 'll see , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you have to that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , my mentor now , talk about this time , and actually about be yes , i do n't know <unk> is beyond the people are going on .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea at all came out there are you to be so do .
i 'm grateful for that you , it , certainly , trouble comes off , and i 'm extremely grateful for me to be part of having me .
that , they also all the people , support , and were .
i acted as i said , many people in the events which , and that i tried and confirmed , that 's good , that go back .
and that we 'll see , i then it .
and say , i thank you .
they come up with us to prison .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you want to give in their <unk> which , if you as the <unk> to come from us whether you the a financial support that are .
if you our program in a new <unk> want to wear , <unk> issue .
you 're talking about us , please .
martin sebastian and i are here today .
and to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i sold at <unk> <unk> for <unk> longer-term <unk> in nepal applied .
in a time , i do something that way .
, you do yes , these things .
now , for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's customers , today , many ways to how to of dissatisfaction deal .
specifically as you dissatisfaction deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here , a lot of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i was able to me , what could color as my ten or two , 30 years will look .
it was a pretty predictable .
and this predictability i found rather frightening .
and it at least to express .
essentially , i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not going to the <unk> to happen ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> back to throw away ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
this was so , the thoughts .
i was in this time , <unk> in a day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> for me was also , fear of the total was quitting .
you 've traveled to them at the world 's living in very good hotels and traveled to the country on a very <unk> way .
traveled but in part , <unk> countries .
the developing world where it sure anymore to see and say there as a quaint forerunner of these villages , kind <unk> people for the , though they do n't have , much greater happiness and joy from .
what a lot of these images and cliché about living but really chronicles a way too .
and that was for me to a while the key .
i was that what i did all of a .
data .
and i found it sort of <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries are really know them .
to <unk> writing articles .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how do you are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
in the people who lives , you home .
not in the hotel .
you want by the challenges and the problems of the people engaged .
and so as you with the people who works .
at that was the answer , i went on this question there was .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something meaningful lives .
i wanted to contribute at .
something to do good .
and this sense , at me , in a <unk> still going on the police .
i was , before , often in developing countries , nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil society , not just many orphans , many economic and social problems and left .
with an annual income of <unk> euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and sewage and continue to the two poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from one of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and write .
all these are connected with very many personal stories and experiences , i on this journey has had met on me in a time , i was ready and frankly , to change .
in the least , is something i wanted .
and drum up after i got back of nepal my decision .
i quit my job .
and she took me in the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt of the answer equity , i on my job application received .
because they just a defining .
it 's going to a serious amazed at <unk> international by businesses .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the wait a degree of time in nepal 's lives and i want a funding , and living in place .
hi ?
it 's still ?
i was really seriously think of and good .
at least i thought it .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really just plowing down .
and i see , the course , a very emotional response was writing .
and , never <unk> .
instead , i ' i do this , right at the sense , to what good out into this issue .
i it used as an engine , to my own company to reasons .
<unk> .
heart work and soul <unk> .
a company that essentially , that offers , then i searched far have .
because the way of a country unlike anything to do .
the way of a country right to meet .
and i want to get in fact , actually live and work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in going <unk> .
<unk> can actually in the two words be disintegrating .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much like the place that , you good so karma , trying to .
that , you do good .
so this is now 'n little bit esoteric path .
but it is n't .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people with us to afford , during to and useful volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , like a different organizers .
but they travel beyond easy way .
you live in <unk> .
and the main goal is n't care as much recovery or as much <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden .
to engage , watch participants and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , such unsustainable tourism , regions of the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism have .
because just the inside the infrastructure to do .
to another we can send sustainable design projects will push .
we can reduce their sustainable design projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of themselves .
are also on not donations to .
and that 's just showing us , for what do in development is all of meaning .
now we have , in our work <unk> in nepal .
convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda , expanded .
and now , about four years to us now i 've got married and my husband and i are also for a team of <unk> question .
we go into the <unk> gone further ?
or if we still getting bigger than thinking ?
if we the <unk> still going on this ?
if we do with this is not only social engagement and sustainable in my but development in a wholeness that ?
and so that , the individual <unk> have ?
or , or specialty , <unk> .
that would then , and basically a new one extra company .
a company that to take a company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy of how <unk> .
we want to the
was the next question .
'n new business ?
i want to go .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we buy a ticking .
because we have the same language .
because we have the same as dreams were dreaming .
because we have the challenges understand .
and so we have in this year <unk> a sister to dive .
<unk> .
and <unk> we push creative companies in its development and to <unk> that we by really extraordinary people are going on .
to accompany we the participants who or a staff member of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> too have the <unk> which do .
and <unk> the <unk> for .
the there 's in <unk> , again .
a matter of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one more advantage .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you 're standing or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown stereotypes .
where you may not enough of a flexible , is to confined in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
when there is a his strength of eyes .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or whether it 's the serenity , you to be coming in fact , discovered .
the serenity things to assume that you do n't change .
and the force , things to change , you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
this is that replacing the inside rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five , and women from uganda .
and sad fortunes and talent .
they would be beautiful , my <unk> for years .
and for years was nothing .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , what design may have in the question is .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so this year , as a <unk> created .
<unk> <unk> product .
products in the people of poverty and find out .
that you an income there .
a future to occur .
we 're talking yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the bake sale , which brings them not only for a year of an income .
but allows us as well , the project , much larger pattern .
this first edition 's sort of social crowd funding and <unk> in a .
so who are going to can this , with the purchase a chain of doing to another he can but with us , directly into the project travel .
it can get to the women and travel , active <unk> .
the long as we 're not only five women a job to be , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal and other <unk> , which we are real identities to work .
this is but this <unk> just a project from our possibility cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and environment .
because the work in just one area easy to little bit .
what happens with the children when the women who work ?
right .
so we have this year , in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre created .
it reaches down in our so uneasily together .
and the power , more sense , as any one project .
collaborator we place and qualification into the various projects .
the width of ways to , then , in the common good work .
and i 'm going to leave you now , right on a journey with you .
and to do , i urge you the eyes to restore .
yes , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden room table .
and are satisfied and it anymore .

there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .

in there is it 's warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> sure .
their <unk> feet tumble through the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
they laugh .
and calls for your name .
you 're looking at you that you off , i wo n't just <unk> .
<unk> .
you know what do n't , what time it 's .
and now , you going up .
and the <unk> , because it 's still the children were , <unk> .
the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia .
in the meadow sitting in the shadow of tree as you probably the new designs of <unk> talk about .
so , as you with my hands and feet to talk .
later , but the other women on this .
they smile , you <unk> .
until you with your english start .
under the tree .
in .
and that it 's still internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
it , looking you .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again deutsch , to talk .
you hear the music .

mom fiona washing in the courtyard of the pots .
they sing an african song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you 're doing the eyes peering back on .
and all of us can see the <unk> to come to what 's something that engage .
or at least for a short time the dice me back to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to be an interest me , whether of them , tonight , they 're here , before , somebody 'n ' house work up .
i just know , with the light , not really well , but perhaps want to someone woke up .
down here just know , i 'm somebody .
two .
here 's a sudden spiking up just know , i 'm not , but anyway , down here are before , two , that 's beautiful , we are before , to <unk> .
i see , which is also a building up to say , the country villa mountain on the city <unk> .
that 's the building .
together with two other people have , i the country villa out in the last summer age six months for up there .
and so stuck , i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you say .
so what it ?
<unk> there 's customers , many .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , what , her work up now the country villa along ?
and you <unk> then in park or how ?
one small plant choice of the questions , we know , friends who have asked when you 've learned that i became part of an initiative with the i started , to , something <unk> <unk> am .
all those that , we reconnect seamlessly in the series of the <unk> <unk> .
and here 's going to these villa <unk> you had , <unk> world faces and bearing banners up .
and to fight against the privatization of villa out to stop protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of finishing up .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see , this is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , you privately simply is , and so for many people do n't available to think there is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is and will not be used to how to public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and along <unk> , sensitive and sustainable deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were an interdisciplinary team and that i have to now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , more design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and relations .
of course the same time , with different social cultural and intimate one another .
our perspective <unk> and the way .

and creative part of living unconventional solutions in the <unk> , and then we did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated directly , villa out to occupy .
however about us about that we villa with stories and ideas that people .
we have to the glory and i 'm asking .
and from these memories and images out to can be , perspective for the country villa out to develop .
and it 's important that the process and more constructive ; it remains .
us as an initiative for yourself , and things than outside of platform and as <unk> terms .
this was <unk> a mental illness and , sit-ins in and they , and better to a <unk> .
in experiences , we use that have made , <unk> ' i tonight is to do .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood face , there .
in many cases , this , privatized law and commercialized and be in the result of citizens of strangers are places .
they are the dead -- a city , because it 's often not the equal , we 're in a public space expect .
so for example , that we <unk> have , <unk> .
to this , but also the fact , public , urban places , neglected , this will often did .
initiatives , these places to want to be a lot better , and scarcity of interest in fact , for the infancy , into .
what 's also with me to do it 's some questions like some of the questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to our own town 's not just a face .
no .
they are the social -- our own town , of our social life is happening .
so how we do there is your first <unk> ties to our neighbors , if you look at random on the way shopping to meet .
and can take this increase , if we just an ai to have to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces are also designed accordingly .
and we just 'n longer converge .
that they form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly , it 's a sense of community .
the more encounters , and in this is a public space and i 'd see , the faster and more of it 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , which is that , you probably the hide a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens , consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can protest in actually be transformed ?
how it 's fair criticism in ideas to be transformed ?
protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the twin towers and actually also not in which <unk> just the same places .
so now , now , they sit here , even ago , they beat the newspaper , and read this text .

they have to the connectivity to the idea of a nuance choose .
and the variation in with the most <unk> is then timely implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this event going ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , if it is just a great .
there 's a way to select .
they have to <unk> , like the future looks .
and again , like the first time it in the first moment .
i trial , let me nonetheless , of an explanation .
and that is , because i the thing i 'm they ca n't really has or pick it forever , <unk> .
so one , because that classical <unk> often too late to <unk> .
that means mostly they have n't have any chance , really your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss them , but there 's actually have been a design and they have to <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city green plants .
or , as a friend other day said , what color the trash , for example .
second thing that classical <unk> is rarely about and vote out .
you think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you and they must then you can vote .
frustration and incomprehension are commonly used to follow what i also kind of which is funny .
i have to do n't instant decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually get a <unk> , instead <unk> <unk> had .
it 's but also different .
although we as overcoming the existing <unk> of conversation in fact , we finally too much greater comfort to know .
so , then we have experience up and the , i for other <unk> share .
i want it pass on others have initiatives , kind of others , or , are going to the city , and the politics .
because of the ones are , like <unk> actually do it should and the really responsible for such manufacturing processes are .
if there is really the interest of what is that , as it so often told and it is then we need and then we need to retrain them new <unk> .
not end , <unk> ' i but also , they all , you today in this .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important , is .
i know , '' it for important that all of you go , and i want to it with our example of encouraging the <unk> still a chance to give .
and i then i me , because they are very , and definitively , who did a new <unk> demanding .
we have to what happens if you look like to perform at the citizens , consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood , and got tired of participation and <unk> to hardly anything ?
one willingness to the conversation on playing field .
in <unk> for professionals in layman to citizens on <unk> and different 's another .
what we see , this is a picnic table , to the we invited .
what we see here , are some <unk> and local authorities in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on playing on today , that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the missing in the citizens .
the citizens got there , are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood , you know what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to mind , which to be a place is , and what you 've got there , lacking .
the <unk> , especially in the city can bring , on <unk> level in the project to do .
the u.s. alone or in a particular case , can , another <unk> be involved in the themes of complimenting , just on the project and are , after .
all this leads to a <unk> , the rest of information for all to are , and then the place to be .
by maybe , you get to return , an identification of the place that controls .
a dialogue , practical level playing also means that the wishes of the residents in fact taken seriously .
and that is also then , if someone says , i want a <unk> the marketplace .
this can clearly in just be , but the needs to be , <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , what is the right solution and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> fit all , but perhaps gotten to another place .
well , the needs to learn from the conversation turns out then form .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , completely comfortable , when he said , <unk> big amorphous group is and talk about .
so , the other can see is good writing to but the text and then not going on <unk> big amorphous group .
someone else 's what might get hostile or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i 'm trying to say it must have different <unk> give to transform flavors of market goods right .
we have here , for the way , just to get there , anyway , what happens .
the back , a small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of , <unk> to give .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
from the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
and we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to play ideas to <unk> .
and the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should always been able to be .
this for instance , about a <unk> happen , it over <unk> <unk> happen .
the providing input and transparent availability of the results of the dialogue in the are .
we even have the whole process in parallel postulate on facebook with him and on one of independent blog and at the news , timely talk about a newsletter that way .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often too late to take place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished planning .
<unk> 's the process , but then when it 's very early development takes place and the who best , even still do n't know , with <unk> we need to happen .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going to the point , where , discussed this is that futures for an area in question .
<unk> heard , we’re going to <unk> itself .
, and then , if not alive in the future is that the <unk> event that and look , it was in experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , and that citizens beat your city from and your city <unk> .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i see , this is an example of <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably in many of this is known .
in new york , just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there , six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to make should or at <unk> .
the time has to in august and wrote the politics could not as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i , i wo n't need to tell , because he has to one of the <unk> the city it was no idea of the politics or educational administration .
the contrary , <unk> for the <unk> were already .

the city was told <unk> is n't necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , we for <unk> <unk> have , the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city offline .
during the side <unk> d e : it works and the city <unk> , the initiative , there 's founded , and other <unk> quest .
and elsewhere painting for their own crossing the streets .
in rotterdam in a <unk> footbridge erected before .
everything well as far , you want to now say .
then we doing but now just so on .
but i think it for there 's the city of the responsibility .
why ?
, firstly , because you know , after a look for it all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it be considered citizens of initiatives , or businesses , the rule on a for you some way , relevant to the focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects , it 's by the attention .
and to another part of course , the city of taking , are other way to provide .
a <unk> initiative that can this is either side of priority .
also our goal was actually a little bit like an initiative that after their research had planned that was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city of those who wanted .
research -- was a big investor has the country villa out in january .
it 's going to know , when there .
so we have unfortunately the moment that that we are still not a number of these were .
but we know , now , that , if the city villa successful <unk> , if the negotiation in fact are successful that then a <unk> be happening is .
in what form of the landscape where is however , frankly .
and finally , now , i 'm convinced that many projects , because of meaning of complexity or , cost of the city has evolved to be a chance to have any satisfaction on and positive identification to create .
you 're only time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all , you tonight is sitting here .
if we bring them on and at the fall because the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than you see , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night , the dress rehearsal , we were here <unk> in <unk> and the <unk> come .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so that this idea , a second chance to have , if it in this life does n't worked , then it harder , a second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were but relatively quickly told us all agree that 's two things that there , we do n't even harder , see that we wanted .
this one is the puberty .
the second there was also , was unity of the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
well , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
in my place it is yes , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words , lead , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck that woman straps , and i just go back on it all the loo .
and then i do n't know , it on you know , but in my exams , and the one with the <unk> taken seriously , sitting in the next to me .
no idea , from the fact , it .
they 'll get it , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was totally surrender their never again in school .
and what do i 'm going to say , when i 'm going on the year <unk> back some of the most days , naturally , i spent i ' , i ' to schools have spent .
with a desire and totally be .
how she 's that ?
like this happened ?
it started first time to worry that something happens is what i do n't be able .
i got kids .
so my wife eventually got the children .
and therefore i was actually , very clear that you one is , around , this <unk> to take care .
to the one day when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
<unk> .
because i opened the door and then i sat there 's sort of in this <unk> , whoa , but i was living in the <unk> .
this was just from , how it 's then , we looked too .
and that as smelly , like how high school at as smelly , and i <unk> ' gim me , human being here , yes real failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , and you know , the children learn not for the school , but it to live there <unk> ' i , my god , that i ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , we from the school , from this high school , for 's life really came to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> before , really good need to ?
and maybe you know some , the state capital from yugoslavia to the beginning .
what 's harder , from yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in the short time as much know in the <unk> , just , so i 'm doing it on a whole again <unk> can , i there 's going ?
well , i see , the time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point had one of it turns out whether someone 's a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic solution is and whether the good diagnostic of it ?
no way .
so , we do for 's not to start school , we learn .
if we so back , so about <unk> the <unk> century , like that god , you voted .
this is the time , in germany in the <unk> then eventually got completely was introduced .
and , the educational system , as we now has its roots .
and if we have the time back then imagine , it was actually the people at the had no access to know your time .
and there were these four or six years , they basically what were forced to the school to go and knowledge of the talk , then actually the only way , and they had to be reunited with the knowledge and the facts and the information of time , connect to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket of the library of that time .
and the <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that means that there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need , these new machines have been able .
simultaneously , but also people who needs , these machines for and repair themselves they .
and we need people , these machines , could and that these factories were running .
maybe you realize it already .
this <unk> system that we now in germany , you imagine still have , has its root , at that .
and it 's potentially make sense done .
also , because it was probably really was that , i in school , because i learned to have , for a structure of the assembly line , who the assembly line up , who stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let 's <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year over 20,000 .
this year over 20,000 was the year there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i was now is the time , now do you on the first company .
after some of around me so the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some of companies are going to allow us <unk> , and bigger and bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are , on us again so in <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we had then after a few years , 30 staff .
so we had this is a growth and we had so interesting thing about careers on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you a real koranic idea have to these people do , but when i the school and we had no idea that 's so ever be .
even when i <unk> did was , so how the internet is still do n't talk .
and the children , we now the school in to what good job to the in 10 , six twenty or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and which know what kind of facts are the to get in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking at who would be able to me because the <unk> for the saturday there .
there 's <unk> the golden rule , i ' i read .
well , you have no idea .
how we can get then got to school for 's lives learning it ?
what are the things that we need to feed kids for 's life being fit to do ?
and maybe it 's a look in in this , businesses today , they were looking .
this is that yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and universities are coming then in the company .
and if you , as a classic <unk> look and then it 's , in the first , so , like the expertise .
there are to the yes , the reading , then we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and this traveled 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school right now , and also in the future ca n't afford .
what school , maybe it 's put these are the things that always important to that are the so-called <unk> <unk> and i convinced that these <unk> <unk> the hard <unk> the future will be .
and the can basically , in three discrete groups .
this is , firstly , too , and staff , flexible are , flexibility and it 's a .
then i wish , almost everybody freeze their employees , they tend to think .
and then you want to these are having employees , <unk> .
so we 've built leaders , thinking and teams .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly by understanding .
if we look at the economy is actually works as quickly , how fast , anything changes .
<unk> , whole business models are the internet , on tomorrow to their head .
there practice , i employees , with that shift can deal .
there practice , i employees , are creative .
there practice , i employees , <unk> .
this is quite the opposite of what the factory out the <unk> century of collaborators , the assembly line is .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial thinking is quite clear .
there 's about the responsibility .
there 's about people , take responsibility .
first time for instance , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if that now the company is , and so when society that we people , you take responsibility for that telescope .
and the third factor , in teams , is almost the number one do .
and if we look at the football world remember , then there 's because the internet , this beautiful saying .
argentina has <unk> <unk> portugal has <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't naíma <unk> , the world has gained .
that the only thing to create .
and so this big one innovator our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the answers , the iphone , invented the has not the <unk> invented , who has a massive itunes n't invented , nothing in it 's invented .
the had a team that made this possible because just as a team began to the do that what they 've done .
so a school , these three things that could that if only but a school , we know , that 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing , and it 's me almost more importantly , .
and that learning is itself .
if the only , we 're talking about the future with safety saying that is that it into uncertainty is then it 's the ability , new to learn and fun doing this to have this learning to experience of is paramount for that we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only , but a school , these things .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the kind of them , have kids , know that 's not just a wonderful event is the day , you <unk> to pay .
so a wonderful event , which all it said , not by each other .
to the moment , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
i sat there and what can i say , and i do <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest pieces of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the subject of homework and learn the entire family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if of the sick staff is , because in school , stress this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> , that school , again so 'n <unk> .
and it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , right after the last time , and in fact , we were also the single parents , who were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and me the fine-scale detail by asking for the point was clear , we have to our child 's your calculators , this is n't .
<unk> but are two years , which we did have , there 's something not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had actually the question which is our child is broken ?
and we 're all the only , where it this ?
now i ' i in the two years , since i fell in the subject to do with very many people , and i see , and found , no way i see , learned , you 're not alone .

and what can i say , he told me almost the same story with one of his children 's almost as we experienced as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children 's take could from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one hand , ai <unk> at different schools and we could even more schools in to consider .
but that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we both right now the impression that had to school , since we were there is not really changed , we thought , yeah well , we 're the first , the issue is now let 's about .
it , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is , we would be fooled .
we 're not alone .
but we 've had relatively fast as a whole range of amazing people found , what you wanted to how we , which is a school to create , all that there are going to do it will .
it is yes , not that only the children and their parents lying under the suffering , out there 's often happens .
if we the teachers at , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look at the evolution of the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the world , doubled .
it can now be that all my parents to be doing ?
that all children dying , and that , those teachers dragged down are ?
or it be that we have a system , that just not more like this fits , like this <unk> ago <unk> the fit just as well , it so right .
and we have many people found , where it gets that went and we 've even people found , not have children .
and they 've understood that they take responsibility to the future that they take responsibility to the future , by take responsibility for that , we our children and the kids , now the school go to hang on the way to be .
and we 've been looking at <unk> second point gotten there 's out there a whole range of like you have initiatives , school want to change , and there are there 's <unk> schools , here and there really cool thing <unk> and there 's almost blindly , every school teacher , really involved , are and something want to change .
and there 's even the a one or bold principal , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had all , no concept that 's where we now about helping us could .
but we can one thing we can live in these are actually go and we can be in these schools in the people , school in is , the parents , and the students , together and we can start with are in two days a lot of moving .
there are so people together , in the past , so each other have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
the come with <unk> it 's challenge of them together to solve .
and after two of those days , then , for a new <unk> developed sooner or the gun given for a completely new high as we 're in berlin school , with me to .
or the have this tangible things for <unk> problems , you your school have , gunpowder .
of individuals within two days after all evolved to find the next day , which can be .
but what this fabulous thing is , what these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful the small number of their weekends , i ' , as well , and schools , germany to spend , is that energy , there is when the three things to learn .

so basically to become leaders , thinking and if you a team of creativity .
then is that a piece of , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , it ai n't manage to come back then we 're learning about that the school as a whole started to change that there ai n't entirely new musical culture .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> , it 's just invite one 's about school to think .
i <unk> , it 's just invite men , i was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they all , but also to invite men , about , flying school , to talk .
you 're talking about the , you like but you 're talking about , at that , what you do n't like .
you will be surprised , how much greater comfort they get and how many people the same have seen , but just not talking about .
you make us , let 's on every school in germany to the <unk> century , we have to
, let 's the entire system .
and , let 's the common to do with the people to school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only thing we can do this .
thank you .
