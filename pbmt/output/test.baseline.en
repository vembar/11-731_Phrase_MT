when steve lopez , funny , go to los angeles times , one day the streets in the center of see , los angeles listening to , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , more likable , rough , and homeless , on a violin and the last , two strings .
of you are going to the story because of <unk> article about it was later a book , this , into the fact , robert downey junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and the very promising was very early by his paranoid schizophrenia was ended .
nathaniel left the juilliard school , a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i 'm going to tell you all , <unk> book to read , or the film to watch , you to not just the wonderful place where the difference between these two men that way , but it 's the music that link to helping and how they finally the instrument was , if this pun allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
i 've <unk> in the years since 2008 , two years ago , walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of beethoven 's first and fourth symphony of and i get behind the stage to do it , i imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and social of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers abandoned it 's ever in the kid world series of creating would . and that all for the <unk> passage of violin at the last sentence of beethoven 's fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music and a few days later i get an email , the status that nathaniel , for violin at me interested .
i have to , even mention that nathaniel a medical practice down , because he was already with an electrical shocks and <unk> and comes been treated , a trauma that it all his life being .
a number of it is now , particularly prone to this did it one . 're sometimes it gets so , and he days away , the streets of <unk> row <unk> , this horror and the <unk> his own mind of sand .
and just a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first of class , walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this . flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke , and about how to anyone in my sleep too to .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid to him lose that it in one of these states immersed could and that i 'm going to its relationship to violin that when i , about <unk> and <unk> and very exciting prospect of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
so i just to play .
i was playing the first set of beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed in the future , <unk> eyes a full of change , went .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible have said , a chemical response , the catalyst of my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turns into , understanding , a quiet for curiosity and grace .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started , on , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and the other protocell b 's already , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he 's not just an encyclopedic know about music owned , but it with you also a network of personal relationship there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that i would just by my colleagues in philharmonic orchestra of see , los angeles know .

music 's medicine . music is moving us .
for nathaniel means that music involves health .
because the music it allows him , his thoughts and delusions of his imagination and creativity in a real to convert .
and <unk> he finds its agonized states .
i understood that this : that the nature of art is .
this : that 's the reason why we talk to do : so we do something , that we all , in the inside this jar , our feelings of our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape .
and the fact that expression of us all , and if you 're going to inspire and that unites us .
what nathaniel of , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> force the music that brought him back in a family of musicians , it 's mind , his art was to and so .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether the case , walt disney <unk> hall , or <unk> row , because he reminds me , `` why i brought musicians have am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .

i hope that you pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes were known .
i only two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate fling with .
it was a fish , <unk> good , it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
even more he <unk> after the supposedly comes out of standards of sustainability from .
you could , so i feel about that , it , to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and asked whether i in an event with you might think about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' , i said .
here was a company , to solve was trying to this incredible problem to us chefs do it . how do we fish on our menus ?

it 's hard to the destruction of accuracy has .
ninety percent of the big fish , the , we love , for example , <unk> , the salmon , this swordfish , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so is arguably , or address <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to give you a pound of <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
theyâ€™re also not very good .
so here was finally one company , it right .
i wanted you support .
so the day , the event and i called the head of the public relations for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don brownlee , '' , i said , `` just about the facts , right , have you are famous for , so far out in the ocean as opposed to her the environment is not an aquifer .
`` this is true '' he said , you . we are so far out that the waste of our fish you will , not focused .
and then put it 's add , `` we 're essentially , really a world .
these <unk> of <unk> to one '' , he said .
`` the best in the industry .
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what is an her ?
`` how sustainable proteins '' , he said .
`` great '' said , i put on .
and that night , i lay in bed , and i thought , the hell 's a sustainable protein ?
so i the next day , just before the event , don brownlee , .
i said , don brownlee , for example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
he said , he had her that he 'll and ask .
now , i always on with a few people in the company . nobody was able to me a 's answer to give them . until i finally began with the senior fellow biologists on .
we call him , don .
`` don brownlee , '' , i said , `` for example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ?
he said , `` yes , putting feathers of skin <unk> , but , <unk> and to forage and data .
i said , `` how much percent of you have a consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent '' , he said .
i said , don brownlee , is that chicken , fish to feed ?
there 's a break in the leadership and he said , `` there 's just becomes a chicken in the world .
i <unk> me of this fish .
no , not , because i a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish , this entertainment , chicken tasted .
this second fish that 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , and i do you , the better to his fish about learning that the fish the more love .
i told him , in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
one of our journalist that had been thinking about of this fish , it .
it 's kind of the set .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing white color .
the chef came , it <unk> .
you know , it twice .
amazingly , he was still , delicious .
who can a fish that well , taste and let after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy 's it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he was the fish are not a cook and he 's not a chef . at the way , you and i that , i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it 's near the <unk> the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the , basically the wetlands .
they did this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complex network , sewers , and you had urged her water from the land out and beyond the river .
now , they could n't make that was fine , not forwards economically .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to me , for this place of birds are .
and has in a spanish company with green the country .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water right .
they 've literally the lever thrown away .
instead of the water <unk> they used the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , manta shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company the environmental destruction all , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and it is that you 're <unk> channels and this dense , lush march .
i was there , not too long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an guy , three parts by charles darwin and part of `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
all right there we were and she fought for us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , i have to take up to my travels at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's how he 's a rare <unk> out .
now i 've said he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here 's shown here 's a pattern of join that it , the tanzanian giraffe , it .
it turns out to miguel of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he , and so a <unk> it .
he said , fish ? i do n't know about a fish .
i 'm an expert of relationships .
and then he goes and sudden plummets , more maybe of those rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't get me wrong , this was really amazing , you know , <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece here 's the fish that i just the brink .
so i put him off . i said , `` miguel , , how come to your fish that well taste ?
he showed on the algae .
`` i know , over the algae , of phytoplankton , relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ?
now , it continues to me tell me that it 's a rich system is the fish caught eating , you the wild , food were .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish have a baseball .
that is healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the more of a farm heard , they are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place , of course it seems to be '' , different than any rural farm , i 've ever been was , `` how it you are succeeding ?
in the moment , it was , like a before exacting a <unk> to have .
and we must bow to the corner and we provided by the most sight , and thousands pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet that far the eye enough .
`` that 's success story . '' , he said .
`` look you through their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> .
<unk> ? i was completely overwhelmed .
i said , is miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ?
yes , he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year was on this site 600,000 birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> in europe , become .
i said , is miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last that you on a <unk> have to ?
he 's going to his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker looks so the belly down the better that .
okay , so let 's the results come . a farm , they are not an and a farm , their success of the health of being able to measure .
a <unk> , but a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos covered by first place did n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the surface better , it 's ever switch .
every morning fly it comes 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 miles back .
you do it , because the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a journey of the penguins had published , i did look miguel sokoloff .
i said , is miguel , fly it comes 240 miles to the farm and they fly , and all 240 miles back on the evening ?
do it to the kids ?
he looked at me , as if i just a song from the whitney houston , who spoke .
he said , `` no . you do it , because the food is better .
i do n't have the skin of my beloved a fish and i 've said , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i love it 's not <unk> . i like they do n't be crisp , .
it is that positively , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet when i you this restaurant in <unk> try to have it does n't even after <unk> tasted candy .
they did sweet and in the thing , as if you a half bites the ocean would take .
i mentioned that , is miguel and he kind .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a swam .
it 's the last areas , something in the body into .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> up .
and then put it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> .
okay . a farm , your fish do n't a baseball . a farm , their success is it 's the success of its predators .
and then i was n't you know if he says , a farm , no <unk> <unk> it , because the water , that through this farm where there 's coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , which are rivers , and make you tend to bring them , to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it spreading through that 's fighting , and this leaves is the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
that is healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , they are not a baseball , not just a farm , their success of the health of being able to measure , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they should also do , because they love story , like this is also telling .
you might argue that it 's a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture from one , the food in fact , and taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not a realist , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if they claim that there are , the future of good food they assure everybody 's somebody somewhere and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today to starve .
one billion -- that 's more than before -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the gas emissions .
now , i like this question is not , because the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about this .
feed the grain of the herbivores to <unk> , you know monocultures , chemicals in the earth 's chicken , fish , and all the time , of agribusiness simply asked , `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful that be ?

we should they call me , it is an industry formed in <unk> , an industry that you , who end of its , the fact , the production that controls .
this is not an industry , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but by making forests , and not by were and nets , but through the fishes in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let it 's start with the question : how we going to feed itself ?
or better , how can we have gotten to create , every community to enable their own , to feed ?
to do that , you look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has ever sees something really good for food produced .
so let 's what the ecological systems model .
and that 's the two billion years <unk> resorts to .
take , is miguel , that farmers like miguel ,
businesses , the worlds for instance , are , businesses , kind of the inflationary theory , businesses , <unk> grow up instead of their own intensely , farmers , not just emitters of these are , but experts , relationships ,
because they are the ones who also hired experts to flavor .
and if i really honestly 'm sure you 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
you know , it 's me right , because if that the future of good food , it will just delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today one thing that want it is that the whole mass of data , we consume that 's bigger than the sum of bits and instead to <unk> to think , i want you to think about how we information that can use that , patterns start to and we so we actually see , otherwise would n't have been visible to be .
so what we see here 's a typical <unk> , old way .
the program here that i 'm doing , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is that i want to take a certain death amongst those filters . say crashes .
and instantly i see a different patterns that , it .
and that is , because in <unk> here to people on the most active are and it over here at the <unk> .
we can be a step further out and make the data and new , and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects , are , but not for everybody .
so when we go and after the number , we 're saying , 40 years or a younger , we can see that are accidents , even the cause is about the way , the people are going to start thinking .
and who <unk> see that this is especially in men 's true .
you realize that looking at a bunch of information and the data that way , swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can do why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the front of every single instance , sport <unk> '' , ever woken up .
it 's all right here . it 's fine line .
you can it would like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you have them in a decade .
you can have them in some sort of a year .
you can go directly to a certain copy one else .
now if i here at night , i see the athletes , in this copy appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , i click go into , all tell me to show in which lance armstrong mentioned will .
now if i just a <unk> so people get to be because i think `` ok , if i keep everything with the subject of walking to look back ?
so i step back and <unk> of view .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and you get an example of that if you this information on , specifically , more , <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or is browsing is n't just .
you 're doing something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it changes and the way information can be .
i want to this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazed .
so here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> and you on a little summary .
the summary of a short in and a symbol of the area of it .
i 'm just let 's the top , especially in the popular <unk> .
but even in this unconstrained view , we can be a lot to do things .
immediately , we get an idea of the issues , on wikipedia the popular .
so i 'm going to the subject <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> , who have i know that the <unk> , the most so , time magazine called `` people of the year , ''
this is really important , there is an insight is , not in a single <unk> is .
this is just to see if you one step back and the whole of wine .
come on a particular kind of <unk> i can then in the subject of the time magazine called `` people of the year , '' in to go , and all together .
now if i all these people consider i know that most of <unk> some people come from the science . some people still less likely to come from the economy that 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now one and a look on the ted prize winner .
you see , we search on the board the first time as if it 's also really a net is not just by side to page , but much more abstractly .
and i want you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser and it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to each one of website as this .

this is why most important , because you just by looking at this stuff of websites , at the way of , all the <unk> on the same way of looking at it .
so i can in my that you zoom in a long time .
here is the entire demonstration , i want to go this talk that i .
and i can kind of all , today i 've looked back .
and , if i went back one step <unk> and on all look , i mean that 's new way , after i 'm <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here you to the inside and it back up .
it 's a metaphor , and it 's used , and every time it makes this picture than the sum of the pieces .
the moment in the world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk from the cursing the <unk> .
we 're talking about the `` from drowning in information . ''
what , when we have this situation turn be in the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , from one to another to go to start by many things to many things go to have , and it creates pattern of see that otherwise , actually stayed still be ?
if we do this can , they do this record <unk> , maybe a new source of the more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it .
and if we know about , we can maybe even wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up to invite you portion of science fiction on .
in my high school i went with the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always a book , a <unk> that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my the me sitting , this voracious curiosity satisfied .
this great curiosity that , that i always , if i 'm not in school , was , the forests <unk> , around and `` where '' which collected , frogs and snakes and here and <unk> , everything to go home to paint and under the microscope at .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the boundaries of explore .
and my love to science fiction conventions like , my environment picture , because then , the late '60s , we went to the moon and were exploring the deep .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing shows , we animals and places and a whole world of miracle that showed that we 'd never have to imagine .
this has , then i think very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither of video , these <unk> with computer-generated performance by movies , all the imagery in the media , there , i had the images in my head .
that we had at the if we as children 's a book to read , we took the description of the author and projected needs them in the screen in our heads .
my response to that was the drawing and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts and so .
in math class , i was all the teachers get that i thought , the textbook on , <unk> .
the creativity to wait a way out .
and he does something interesting . what i mean , to jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea of us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would pull out , i never an alien world with a spaceship at reaching . that to me very likely .
but here was a world , i actually enter it was okay , here on earth , and it was also fascinating and exotic as the stuff that i 've always imagined when i the books had read .
so i decided when i was 15 , marine science .
the only problem that was that i had a small town canada has lived , one over 12,000 miles from the ocean from .
and i let me , but not willing .
i great fact my father , he got a <unk> in buffalo participants did exactly the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> the winter winds in buffalo , new york .
the ocean , but , a real ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we 're going to california to flat .
and since the past 40 years , has a story are , i know , three , for an underwater spent . 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature knows , no borders , very , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to end of days i feel that deepest awe of this , i have on my early dives see .
and my love to the ocean is looking at , with the same intensity as time , and the .
when i realized then as an adult encountering a profession <unk> , during the <unk> .
it seemed the best way of my inner drive , stories to tell me with my desire , of creating , to unite .
of drew me , and about comic books and .
so , films in the way , images and stories about string . that fit together .
of course , the stories , i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and , `` <unk> . ''
so , `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the underwater and that come with the <unk> connect .
so intertwined over , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' to a <unk> problem in this film company to -- and that we had this kind of liquid <unk> create -- , the we 're going on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what , it ends up was the first computer-generated <unk> , ever in a movie came to see .
by the moment to do is no money just said , he played , just about his was caused by that , but i noticed something fascinating , the audience around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic that the of it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law are we know <unk> technology and magic , i wo n't have to tell them .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , that i have to be in the cinematic be involved .
so we went in `` the terminator or two '' , my next movie , much further .
together with <unk> and we were there was the guy from liquid metal . the success was one , like this effect come to fall .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a very new world 's approaching , a very new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan winston , the time the best <unk> and <unk> had it was called `` the digital <unk> . ''
the concept of this company was it , phase , analogous processes with visual sophisticated , to skip the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we do then , and -- gave us as a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s years , a day , we that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we get the company yes , basically founded had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar , '' written that the bar in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects , new heights take up with realistic about human , expressive characters , using <unk> there were essentially , and the <unk> should all <unk> and the world to <unk> .
but the bar put stuff back . and the people in my company that told me that we temporary still , can not able to be that to create .
so then shifted that i and made this other movie about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet , on a ship '' i sell it was a <unk> epic amount of a film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually the real temperature up at the titanic ourselves .
so i have the film did .
that 's the truth . that we knew that but not .
i but they convinced , and i said , we come to the cover up . we continue filming the real roughing up .
we 're going to make it in the <unk> of the movie .

and i <unk> an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that that the own imagination a reality we can actually create .
we then we 've actually six months later a reality , i fell in a russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the north atlantic , and i the real titanic through a <unk> at .
this was not a film , not definition , that was real .
so that has really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had to give cameras and light and all sorts of building .
and i fell on , very these <unk> , a <unk> life .
well , they were also <unk> and once required <unk> planning .
you ascend up in the capsule , it you this dark , hostile environment down , where no hope , saving is , if you do n't it yourself back to do .
and i said , `` wow , this is as well , as if i in a science-fiction movie .
this is really cool .
i was really obsessed by studying the deep .
anyway of the part , curiosity and science . and it was fine it was it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , me to do n't be able .
because you know i could be a creature imagine , for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't that 's imagine , i outside the window would see .
in a number of the expeditions i being in <unk> seen , and things that i still never seen before , things , even though , nobody ever seen before had and for that science to the time , they actually , no words had found .
that 's so i really transformative , and i wanted more .
and i met then a particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i mean <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice , and i 'm going to a while <unk> .
and then we started , we dropped to `` bismarck '' , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took a little robots , we built were , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , and occupying the ship at , we 've never did was .

well , and i 'm now , on the deck of the titanic , a <unk> , and see <unk> , this <unk> here 's quite similar and of which i know that once the band over there 's coupons .
and i was with a small <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going to do it is just really , but my mind is within the vehicle .
it felt the way , as if i happen within the <unk> the titanic there .
this was the most surreal of <unk> , i 've ever seen plenty of have . because before i each other to a corner on , you know , i always , in <unk> the vehicle of dignity , because i conducted months , <unk> did was , the film did .
this set it is an exact replica of the plans of the ship .
so that was a very peculiar background in .
they made me this <unk> that what you can have this <unk> avatars are using and that 's own consciousness in the vehicle , these different form of existence with fractals .
it was incredibly profound
and maybe a brief reference , that , maybe in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to explore or other things to do , all kinds of <unk> <unk> , i as <unk> imagine .
after this mounting expeditions we started this , we 're going down there , really appreciate to know , for those <unk> , where we have this an amazing animals we looked at that are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live , chemosynthesis .
they 're not in the sunlight , based system as we do that .
and you see animals , right next one of 500 of degrees are you to survive there .
the same time so i also very much for <unk> , that was back the <unk> from my childhood .

this was fascinating .
but the end it was on beyond that i <unk> with us the deep into this .
i took them , and <unk> you access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources , so that you look around , where they 're taking and instruments in testing those were , etc .
we did that is the documentaries no , run , but for science , more specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock , the circle between my existence as <unk> , then as a child , and the those in the reality .
, over these so i was a lot of learned .
i 've got a lot of science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director to work , you can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood but not a lot of leadership skills , i do this mounting expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to say , i 'm actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking movies tend to bring us no money .
we play time on the by a . of fame not a lane .
all think i was between `` titanic and avatar , '' <unk> and have told me a car in the steel nails it on a towel the beach tweaked her .
i 've all these films , the documentaries no , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will be able to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there are you 're doing it 's the <unk> because , and because of the funny connection , that if a small group of people in a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , many years , broadcasting 've been . sometimes we were two to three months in the lake .
and this community you realize that the most important thing that anything is , you , each other , because you a task . that you make any other that can explain .
if you look at that , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , <unk> , and this very vague idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human need to the lake has been working '' , you can the other just do n't explain . this is the police or in ] soldiers , something together have gone through , and know that it 's never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , one of each other respect .
so when i came back to my next film `` computational avatar , '' , i tried to get to the managing to , that you his team have respected , and in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on with unknown terrain . we were about `` computational avatar , '' with a new technique , it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to , family .
so , changed my way , movies , to do , completely .
it was giving people , they said , we have these <unk> yes really good and put on the pandora 's used to go .
for me it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the result has changed .
what can we from all the end ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , in the first is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality we can actually create .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me he , filmmaker , say , `` you give me a final advice that i thought that can do .
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
the store and yet others to do n't it you to other , she 'll do n't want to themselves . but take risks , you . ''
the nasa has become as a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative .
but in the art and the study to fail an alternative to be because there , i guarantee it 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation called for instance , ever done without risk being addressed .
you have to be ready , these risks , to take .
that 's the idea , who i like to deal with the way to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that i 've just maybe something that , because my <unk> in the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is , the things that we create and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to bear .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people in fact , even more than for each other in the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years not to grow . it we have a weight or of a rain . things are , that change , how it their fragile environment is not withstand a button .
and that <unk> . it leads to handle uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for them .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
fact is that you 're only from one , the price down could to <unk> would energy far and away the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there 's a rapid transition case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators -- that painless climate , we can modern composite materials that , and many things do .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , when we have the price down -- let 's go to the price in half -- we meet in a roadblock , and this barrier to do with carbon .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually quite clear .
they <unk> that for outcasts , co2 , which to <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative , mutagenic effects on the weather and maybe even worse , this is a consequence that the natural ecosystems , this transition changes not to this and this whole systems together .

and there 's safe <unk> about how bad these technologies , but they 're very unhappy being .
i 've got the <unk> times asked , `` we have to really down to close to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ?
the answer is it to be near zero is the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high office truck , under a consortium 3 feet a bridge from . the can then sort of diarrhea , and down .
this must be very bottom , they need to zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of poor countries , less a .
and the average is it about five billion tons for everybody in the planet .
and somehow we need to change that , this zero , down .
it 's been consistently as up .
just different economic transformations are , it 's actually affects and we need to of <unk> rise to reduction and go to a reduction in the way to zero .

you make us , which element of individually and look out that we think of course , and this zero , it .
likely to one of these very close to zero .
now that is a basic algebra , but we take it 's go through .
first , we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people
and it is on foot 9 billion to . to 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could this as well to 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but , what we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services , we use .
that includes all , food , we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> means those services are almost any of the planet to .
it 's amazing that this number up .
in the rich world , the upper half billion , we could i would stain , and less use , but the average is that every year go and thus , collectively than double , as well , services , per person to be provided by .
here we see a very basic services . there 's home , and light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so you go out and read their balls whatsoever worked under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , energy per service , there 's got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services let me see , 90 percent to reduce malpractice .
in other service , that the manufacture of lead back , it 's been doing <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement is very much .
in general , if we make these are , maybe a reduction in a factor for three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we are now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons gone . and that just not from .
we look so the fourth factor , and this is a x-factor be -- this is the amount of co2 , per unit of energy <unk> will .
it 's the question is whether you this zero , can get .
if you coal from burning , no .
if you natural gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables and nuclear passion .
so what we 're going on a global level to do , is a system of law .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor inside is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people have here to the development of a lot of miracle that contributed .
usually photographing there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain date needs .
normally what you basically just wrong and some people did n't .
in this case we need to but the floor to be , and a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked me , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration , by the idea of people here with ?
i think back at last year , when i these mosquitoes and somehow , liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know it , that people there , with these life .
for energy i noticed that 's a .
i decided that this is releasing of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment that this would be .
here are so a couple of natural or fireflies .
it helps me that they do n't bite . in fact , you will probably not time that glass of it .
now , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need to build solutions , either one or a couple of an incredible scale and how incredible dependability . and although it 's many ways , there , where people do , for , i really just five , of these various needs to afford .
i tides , <unk> , merger and better biofuels out .
these afford to maybe one ; and if you better do when i expect , that would be great , but my core here is that we 're in those five to work , and we ca n't of them up , because it 's imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , , burning of either way coal or gas .
what you there have to do , like maybe it , it 's not . to all the co2 , something that the burning of an aerial part comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and somewhere between them and hope that it there 's left .
there 's some well , this is on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult . and a way that for the storage out of co2 to achieve that 's a great challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to make sure ?
who can be to guarantee , literally a billion times bigger than any kind of garbage , the reason , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .

the next thing , nuclear passion .
the also has three big problems . the cost <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that does n't go wrong , despite the human organization that the fuel not for weapons that 's used .
and so , what do you with the garbage patch ?
because even though he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems , maybe in insoluble form are , and that you so to work .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized why .
it are the power renewables , very often be called .
and also the have -- although it is that you do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
for one is the <unk> , these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , talks by many <unk> , 1,000 times more land area as a normal power .

the it 's not all the day , it 's also not every day and it blows , the wind may not the phone .
so you must have to having mash-ups of these vent sites on this is a way to have , energy , in times when you 're not available there is to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we say , say that the energy outside the country is , you do n't just the technology , and they need to do with the risk around the solar energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the way to show , i looked all sorts of us batteries , there are , at the world : for cars , computers that cell phones <unk> , and that i did with the amount of an electrical energy , which the world 's reading , compared . i found out that all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes of the energy between them might .
we need is so a breakthrough something that to a factor than 100 vastly better , it 's when the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
that 's what happens when you 're trying this <unk> sources of what we 're saying , 20 percent -- 30 percent of oil used to .
if you see , 100 percent of it up trying to do you need an amazing with things .
now , where we to go , is the right approach ?
steve , manhattan project '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , working on that . hundreds of .
in every one of five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many of you will say , which are crazy ! it 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's a lot of the workforce , there 's been engaged .
bill it has several different companies , one of an artist named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies to the great things , and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
it was nathan and i pay for a company , that may surprise , the nuclear anything about who tracked .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; repetitive , either .
the development has in this industry some time ago stopped , it 's no big surprise that some good ideas around .

that 's a crazy idea .
but actually had about a long time thinking , but you could never as you can run , whether it would work , but since it modern middle background -- there , you 're modeling and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it 's like this is that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is the <unk> very much better .
actually burning to the garbage , and you can even the waste of today for them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , they burn it just one thing .
this highly enriched uranium dioxide is too , of , like a candle that .
you see that 's sort of the pillar is often when a traveling wave of the reactor '' by the .
that will actually the <unk> .
this is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . it has the part of today , you will , <unk> so it <unk> uranium .

and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough of the fuel for the rest of the lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , we need to going forward .
we think of course , and our success is abusive to .
how to our own testimony to look ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to get to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction translates to 2050 .
it 's very important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in poor countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .
so , these 80 percent to have to the developed , including those countries like china , their <unk> completely to change .
the other note she says , if we have the <unk> technology in fact , whether they all the developed countries used is and we 're going on the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there back , like that 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the on the way to we have to the less we <unk> , the discover is the <unk> be and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we have businesses , not completely to the big <unk> lead , just right , or in fact that matter less as the other ones that the rapidity of innovation for those major breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs to do we floor to track and that we can measure , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the thinking about air .
they go it really , and create a contemplative frame , this wide would be discussed in them , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very specific to accommodate that we do this technology making .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could make the president to choose , a vaccine doses , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 is being invented . this desire and take me .
this has the biggest impact .
if we do this desire does n't get there to the dig in between the long and short term is think people are terribly disorganized to , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich countries . and all life of these two billion are very much worse .
so how do we ?
for what kind of <unk> i
to prepare for more research into it .
if countries , places like <unk> they should not worthy of co2 .
they should those <unk> go and they would be shocked by the ridiculous , low money , for that cutting-edge approaches one .

we need to spread the message .
we need to be robust conversation was the entire bacterial code lead and also the things , from the government be done .
it is a desire , but i think we can see it needs .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you just to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get to us an idea of the scale that investment back to work ?
bill gates : the simulation in a supercomputer to do , all of scientists to get me , we 've done , we need some , 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to make sure that 's about it 's using , in the <unk> million .
the difficult is take this building on the first doing , another billion to find , <unk> and the place for the fact , the first of them .
once the first is finished , when he said that 's as i promised , everything is very clearly , because the sense , <unk> is different than with nuclear passion , how we know it .

bg : right . now you have to the reactor , they want to put into , there 's many people and lots of control is , go wrong . this thing where you get it opens and stuff come in or out . it 's not good !
but if you very cheap parts of fuel the fudge factor for 60 years into -- you think of an essential pillar -- that they bury them , without all the complexities .
and it 's sitting there and while for 60 years and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution to the garbage is .
bg : yeah well , with the garbage that happens : that you know him sitting there 's -- there 's much less food waste , with this method -- then take it and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start by showing that we the garbage can take that already exists , this <unk> or <unk> in the reactors is . it 's what we <unk> .
so , this is , for these reactors run a problem was that , we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce overall skill , this process .
but while you with different people , this world of these opportunities 've talked ,
where 's the interest , so really doing ?
bg : well we 've still not on a place a zoning and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's a big interest and the people inside of the were in russia , india , china -- i was here and i have the minister and talking about it , like this to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese , in the way done .
this is a nuance of thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody knows , a rapid reactor implemented a <unk> for our first .
in your idea : long time and odds against that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that 're very affordable , we have 20 years to create and then 20 years to use .
this is the deadline , us the <unk> demonstrated that we all need to .
and you know <unk> , if all walks , and that 's a wish , it could easily .
and , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , , as well , when their policies of work the federal funding for your drone pilots works for <unk> .
and it would be the best , when it 's several create , because then you could a mixture of you .
anyway , we need a solution .
about the great variety of major breakthroughs , this is the largest you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the most important .
so that it , the <unk> been , but it 's still so much more .
in the nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we know the work , not good as this , but there 's the up to it 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard , maybe it 's say that looked over us .
and so there 's different , but the nice about that is a <unk> a million times as much energy has like a say a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can get around and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost of the potential , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own league table .
if that does n't , what ?

bg : if you this situation is , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and just a heart attack it 's , what do you ? it might be a she or anything .
there 's a <unk> the <unk> called the workforce , with various techniques into the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer just had to us <unk> .
that 's just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need .
some people say that should n't just kind of the insurance to work , because one that might be lazy you can go and eats , because you know that one that she save this is .
i do n't know if that smart is , you look at the importance of this problem , and leads , but now there 's a larger discourse in <unk> about whether you that 's available to have to , the things faster or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have a or two large sentences for the war , you might try to ?
bg : well , unfortunately , who live in the skeptics in very different the .
who , the science of arguments that are very little bit .
they say that 's negative effects , there , with the clouds to have , things here ?
there 's very few things that they do need to say , which it 's a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake , and pays for very much later .
and so this is the idea , if you all kinds of forward has problems , something to invest in that you only later , which has and there 's that the investment , not solved it has actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario and there 's people in the rich world , the ipcc are at and say , okay , there 's no big drama .
the fact is , that uncertainty , we 're going to do .
but my dream here is that if you put it economic collapse to identify and at the co2 was eliminated , also the skeptics , it , i 'm not that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish , that it did that , but i 'm it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the way this method .
and that would your response , that <unk> comes argument that , you look at all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , suffer from it , <unk> , we face of malaria and so that 's a stupid waste of resources which is money to invest , while it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , what actually spending for the research -- we say the u.s. government should be 10 billion per year , spend when they do today -- that 's not just dramatic .
it should be other things do n't suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and , here are sensible people disagree with , if you something that does n't have economic is try and that to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it 's because that 's very quickly with a <unk> and financed , the learning . i think we should be more things to try and the potential have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich up .
i mean , all of us here could , five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even comes to think anybody .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , it needs ?
he 's still , because of his earlier , with the <unk> associated , but it has understood that 's a very rare group is and so it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , who i for them , all right .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little bit of which is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that you wish that 's going . so much .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> ''

the marshmallow to on top .
and , although it really easy it 's actually really hard , because it 's people who is very quickly work together .
and i thought that this is an interesting idea is that i and what 's a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops world -- 2001 , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is something at this task , at some insights in the nature of collaboration with that and i want to some of them to share with you .
usually on the most , people in the task to orient .
they 're talking about you go to look like it will look , they wrestle ,
then on them a little time , planning and organization . it out and put eating .

and finally , just before they were no time , have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently in the top , and to step back and `` <unk> '' ! admire them to work .
what but then , what happens is that `` <unk> '' and a film `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of the marshmallow is causing the whole thing to bend and <unk> .
there 's sort of people saying , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course there 's also on the more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and the best are totally fresh alumni of this kindergarten .
and it 's pretty amazing .
how we peter was to make it 's not just any of the towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask yourself to this is how is that ? what about that ?
and peter told , `` none of the kids who spent time in it 's head of eating <unk> to be . ''
they spend any time <unk> .
but there 's still , another reason .
and that is that mba students are trained by , the one right plan to find , ok !
to and then to realize .
now what happens , if you do the marshmallow the top of them , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?

constructionists recognize this kind of the collaboration as a nucleus of <unk> about .
and every attempt to get the children 's what we heard what works and what does n't .
this is the performance , using prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how other teams to operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> that mba students thus create the half of lawyers or something more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than the adult .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , .
tall is , i 've seen .
and it because triangles , and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
the ceos are something about the average . but here 's interesting .
you a will administrator at the team , you can dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see `` this team will win .
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they 're holding on the <unk> .
they pour the process , you get him .
and that team that system that and in terms of attention is the performance of teams to dramatically improve .
specialized skills and <unk> and the combination lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have , the typical 're going to get you ca n't know , six , stable structures .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered to a $ 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone 's a <unk> of construction and he have the price to go home by .
so it 's not interesting that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the benefit of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , for team of the best .
they produced the construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us of the nature of incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact , invest a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to multidisciplinary teams to help our cars video games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is it helps them to make assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience a common language , or sterility . ethos , the real device to build .
and this is the value of experience of this simple little exercise .
and those of them , it 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world as people that have and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is the structure actually a <unk> sports is .
it demands that we have all our senses in to fix them , that we think can optimally use , like our feelings and we do , the challenge , of us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- and a film `` <unk> '' moment to .
and that can a big deal .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time .
and everyone in this room to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past go , you can in the future go ; they can not in here , and remain ,
and i wonder , they would choose , because i my friends in a lot lately that question for himself and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back before it 's cars , or twitter or `` america for the american idol ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're kind of the nostalgia , and wishful drawn is .
and that i can understand .
i 'm not part of the age group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and that 's not , because i 'm a principal explorers i --
it is that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
i so in this machine , and i in the future go .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet there , which is they make : health , kind of mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died of when they were 60 were .
my grandparents had urged her this number on 70 .
my parents are the one of the way down into iraq .
there should so eloquently than a nine the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not all time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a child that today new born will be able to find that long way to live as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . smallpox , billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war ever done .
they 're way . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , millions of us , just one generation , threatened , that 's still .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
knows all , then they do this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , this is that successes of the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method that things out , to see if it works , it change , if it does n't , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
this is the good news .
unfortunately is that during the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often talk about ,
and one of this is that -- despite our greatest achievements , a billion people in the world every day 's going to sleep .
this number up , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our imagination to be used to this world that we had to your choice .
water , <unk> country has rainforests oil gas , they disappear , and soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> go so we also .
so the idea is , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , billion people are going , without the country , you to rape .
i think we can take this world with energy to plant , they 're not both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is holding me at night up -- of the things that i looked at night awake . we 've been progress , it 's never need to look like now , had n't ,
and we were also still never enough , it properly <unk> , like we it today .
we are the verge , amazing , astonishing design events on many places . and yet , i really that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment go back to start to a time , we progress so there have to the we 're talking about these things from massive <unk> have , more as one than now .
the people around , which they believe , and so intimately that you do n't free .
it 's the truth will you free .
and they stop , everybody 's a right on their opinion , ; even a right on their opinion , for progress ,
you know what they were not quite have ?
they have no right on their own . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while they needed to get the figure out .
ago about a decade , i was a piece of vaccination , `` new yorker , '' written a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to hit the resistance to the world , the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humankind .
i did n't know , i should do , so i just what i always do , i wrote a paper , and i went on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about genetically changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people who played his mind .
so i also about an article written and i could n't understand why the people thought that would `` <unk> '' , why they thought that , molecules on a particular kind of a random jumble of around a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we do we go eat that 's okay .
but these articles were made me , and i could n't figure out , why , and i found it turns out .
and that 's because , these <unk> , me nuts were actually ca n't <unk> were .
that were prudent people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so by ...
but then i thought , you know what , let 's honest .
we 're on a point where , we 're not the same relationship to the progress , as i used .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we 're talking ironic when it with little quotes about , `` progress . ''
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know what 's reason that are .
we have the confidence in institutions , authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason why that 's not be .
you can just a couple of the name might call and the people to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , of mass , <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask and problems with the guys , which we believed that , feel like being right . be you so skeptical .
imagine them questions for you have evidence that urge you some evidence .
they take nothing as well .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have to this evidence to think , and that we 're not good .
and i can it out of the reason that we now an epidemic of the fear for life , how they still never seen and that i hope will never see again .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story , the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in connection to paint .
very scary .
of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
of studies should be done . that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no significant correlation , no link , they do n't .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we anecdotes , we think , we see what we 're going to see believe what does that , we really feel .
we do n't think of a sack of documents from a <unk> , the us data , there , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating ,
getting thousands of fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , which the immunization rate to get measles , .
this is and scandalous that we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened that we could do .
now , i understand that i am .
because it 's somebody get measles ?
has a single vine in the audience ever get to get measles die see ?
it 's not very often .
what happens in this country do n't , but to 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths made by measles , 20 per hour .
but because it 's happening here is to do we go out , and people like jenny mccarthy can run around and writing messages of anxiety and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can make it also cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things to be seem , but almost never the same .
and it 's something that we learn to figure out , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us by one of the worst checking the humanity .
not afraid , not many moons , polio , go pfft , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , not very much .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
it can get the lives of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing save .
well . not ?
now , that 's good , besides that that paul around and of vaccines that there 's and how valuable they are , and that people just quit should be able to stay complaining .
and that he says in fact that .
paul is a terrorist .
if paul charges in a public scene , he can not without fully armed example , statements .
he gets calls home , because the people obey him to tell you to know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul wrote a vaccine .
i do n't need this say , but vaccines are essential .
you take it continues to return the disease they really terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now get measles .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because this is a question of numbers .
and they 're not only thing to get measles die .
what about polio this ? we take it 's why not ?
a <unk> of me has told me a few weeks ago written and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio immunized . not .
subtle .
because we do n't polio , you know what ?
we had in this country was n't see polio program .
now , i do n't know , maybe she morning is anyone in lagos , in a plane and going , and los angeles , the moment he 's about ohio .
and a few hours it lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is to visit .
and he does n't know that it with one of debilitating illness there is , and we know that 's not know , because that 's the world .
this is the planet , we live . they do not , as if he does this is .
we love it , which we can lie to contain itself . we love this .
they have this morning is all their supply vitamins , okay ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that you in can help .
i know that they 've done , because half the americans that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data up the time .
they them their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to hear from 28 billion dollars to dark , urine numbers .
i 'm with them , to .
in the urine . dark .
why we do it ? why we do it ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one way to be strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should also not our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where youâ€™re going to ?
we walk in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
you know that 's a really serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we 'll give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of little slice through here .
none of them -- <unk> , , <unk> , , <unk> , because i do n't know what this is , but we 'll give a billion dollars for it from , it was .
and you know what if i think that would say , cry for me the people , and we say `` what does it you ? let the people but what you want .
so , it feels good .
and you know what they 're wrong .
because it . i do n't is , if it 's the minister is the , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , your patients with <unk> them to .
if you , wanting to take that went to think and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them to a place , they do n't want to be .
they get to i mean in south africa .
he brought about 400,000 employees of people to , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , which we know that you the course of aids , so that can .
hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you to tell me not that these things are no grave implications .
the system , you . they 've always .
now , <unk> epidemic , we 've got at the , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically modified foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , that we 're talking about , was the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in paradise .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years deemed done .
and some of this has been working and some of it 's not .
we 're got to do n't work .
now we can it more and of course there 's risk . but we can do something like , vitamin a in rice do , and this stuff can million people helping million people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , that i do n't understand .
we refuse genetically changed the food .
why do we do this ?
now , i always listening is to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we 're not a huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies alive and patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and you know what my answer , this is ?
they are right . fix .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but it 's not science .
it with science has nothing to do .
now , it 's , right now , <unk> .
you know , the science does n't company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not let 's an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does he and sometimes not , but the idea that we do science , not allow you to her work to do , because we 're afraid , is really a dead , and it 's making millions of the people flourishing .
you know , the next 50 years we 're going to 70 percent more than growing food to better than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need this , and we give you what it does n't .
and what 's genetically changed the food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , <unk> .
<unk> 's something that 's a half billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a sack of calories . it 's miserable .
it does n't it 's not a protein , and scientists building that all right now at a .
and then you might be the people on the food and would n't think there are .
they would not a starving , and you know what ?
so that if it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , i want to tell you can do is why are we do this ?
i mean , we ask : why are we do this ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about genes been around . it 's not enough to use chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our it be on more food , better food , act at food .
it 's not about the rice <unk> , it 's about , people at the lives to save and it 's time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do it , if we so on doing as far do we started to a little bit guilty , we i think they 're not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no one label for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our n't worthy , and we need to the really stop them .
after this amazing kind of entertainment when you so perhaps , `` you still in this ridiculous time and the future go ?
anyway , . that i want , so this .
the moment is it in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this machine on all imagine what we want .
we can you 're moving into , where we 're moving into want , and we are they 're going to move where we want .
we need to those conversations have , and we need to think , but if we 're in the time up and the future go to be happy to be made that plots .
i know that we do it can , and as it as i 'm like this is something , the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've come for the <unk> . it might seem curious that , a magician interested in that , it 's because they look at it as i am , when a deception that to a real space is , if someone just stuck , to believe in it .
other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , which is just for that because the person thinks , with her going to be a pharmaceutical facilities , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for instance , there 's when the patient 's only found was enough to believe in it , a measurable effect in the body , you the <unk> called .
a deception is going to a real , because somebody 's like this world .
so we 're also understanding , i want to tell you a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'll show you , he works . that 's a trick , the least for the 1950s , any <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> scout in magic , we say the 1970s learned .
i 'm going to him for you do to and then explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why him to explain .
so you see what happens .
the knife , that they 're going to ; my hand , they 're going to .
i 'm going to the knife just so in my off .
i 'm my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist on right here <unk> .
this way to show you that , none at any moving . as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve up as it or out .
and the thing about this is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is the knife by my bare physical poisons , magnetics for future .
it 's sitting in fact that , in its place to deliver it shake it without realizing that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , comes out no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> .
now , this is a trick , who i was a little kids to affect the magic interested , and you can be very much about deception know if you delve deeper look , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is the , in that , the secret of illusion is .

wonderful trick ?
back there is , someone who do this childhood had .
so he , this is exactly .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why this point of this is why you 're not perceive that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way he information and data , they 're not one 's one , two three , but it into a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and open i mean by hand .

and when i mean by hand , let me , it 's the same thing , and i <unk> , going through this movement hidden behind me that the finger , again <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and this is the knife .
this trick that you can your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , has the <unk> to do ?
one year ago , or so i read a study , i really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so that was for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in a white or so they provide , the shape of a <unk> , is that just a round , white or so , one of measurable effect .
but if you the , when you that <unk> give an example , in a smaller and so changing , and these blue color and a letter to define , it is actually a measurable more .
and that even though , no one of any of these facilities -- it are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not good as a blue pill .
what that made me really crazy .
it turned out , but that this is still not it 's .
if you capsules that it , the people are still more than lots and every form .
a colored the capsule , in one end of yellow and another red is it 's better than a white capsule .
and the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not good as three pills -- i can now not going to the exact does remind . i 'm sorry .
the key but is ...
... that 's also the radiation doses of play .
and the plays a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to you have to the needle in your grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a diabetic patients into .
that creates a very strong brand image in this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i 'm you a different times show , when we have a ping-pong table .
fact so is that the white or so , not good looks like the blue pill , not good looks like a cramped capsule , not good looks like the needle .
and it has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , let 's a greater impact on .
i want to know if i do this idea for a trick could use .
i suspect something that obviously a deception is , and let 's really look .
we know , yes , from the study that you to the needle to grab , if it on the thing to go .
this is an 18 two feet long <unk> . it 's very , which is . and i 'm going to you first a little bit of sterile .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special cultured meat .
this is my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin for biting commentary and through them up , you the other side , hats .
if you it 's going -- if you can easily in order collapsing fall -- i have this is a few friends last night in the hotel room for the , and some people , i did n't know , and a problem is a woman , he 'd become .
i 'm so ago , if you very bad will , you look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm sort of sensitive to the back here .
it can see in , you can but also <unk> , if you 'd like .
so it is , right here , where my meat starts , the lower part of my <unk> i 'll just a small one puncture , do .
you know i really sorry . it does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , we do the <unk> .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so i 'm going to you show you . this is a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , the people think , if you see that .
they say , that 's certainly not really dumb , and <unk> of the skin , just to us for a few minutes to talk .
now , i will it 'll show you .
look like this from ? well .
i know .
and the people back to say , . i think that 's not seen .
the people in the <unk> are now in .
you make it was to them from the next to show .
it 's my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
i 'm sorry . if you it 's going to you look at it .
the people back or the , that later , eventually , on video will say , `` well , this is yes fairly impressive from , but when it 's really would he would be -- you see here 's a hole and if it 's really would it would we bleed .
okay , so let me a little bit of blood for you <unk> .
it is .
normally would i now the pin it .
i would my arm , safe and show you that 's not our wounds .
but i think , this on here and the intention , from one of being a real , to do , i 'm going to pin it in there 's and from the stage go .
we 're going to the next few days , another couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , it . thank you .
everybody talks about today about happiness . .
i have some people the number of books are now , with `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years out , and they have to think about 40 on , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier lives .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's a couple of the cognitive fall , it , almost impossible make sure enough about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for layman , of their own happiness might think , and it is for scientists , about happiness might think that , because it turns out that we just mess that are like everybody else .
the first of their word is a <unk> , complexity by admitting this .
it turns out to the word for happiness is simply not a useful in the word , is , because it on to all of how to work .
i think there 's a particular meaning in it , this to be possible , and large , all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated that would have to her what well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
, and are two very different and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being , but that 's not without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now , i 'd like with an example start by someone who , a <unk> had to one of my lectures , a story was reporting . [ unclear ... '' ] he said , he could have a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music and the very end of the shot , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's add , really quite emotionally , it angered the whole experience ever ruined .
but that i did n't .
what it did was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i wished .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care about not , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory and everything was , he goes to keep getting .
what 's actually says , is that we 're talking about us and about other people think might in terms of two types of themselves .
there 's a <unk> that in the present lives and the presence today knows , is able to the past back to experience , but that is basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> that the doctor <unk> -- so you know , the physician at the past , `` now it hurts , i turn it 's <unk> ?
and then there 's a <unk> and that <unk> itself is that , the drain , and the story of our lives to maintain one , and it 's one that the doctor 's been by it 's the question is , `` how they have , lately , feel ?
or `` how was their journey to albania ? '' or so similar .
that are two very different entities that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and the two to confuse this is part of the ensuing the question of happiness .
now , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really dealing with a basic reaction to our memories , it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we have to make stories to tell .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we of our experiences for too must is a story .
and let them <unk> with an example .
there 's an old study .
that are real patients , a painful procedure in .
i 'm going to not get into detail . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , as this study the 1990s in bandages .
they were asked to all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that your records .
and they 're asking , `` who of both have more suffered ?
and that 's a very simple question .
a b 's clearly , suffered . <unk> was concerned and every minute of pain , the patient having a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients that you struggled with ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient having a in a lot <unk> <unk> to the <unk> had as a patient , b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a really matters a lot of the story is how it ends up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , even worse is it , where the pain , the end on its peak . it 's a very bad history .
how do we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> 've ever wondered , and also much later , `` how it was the whole thing in general ? `` ,
and it was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
second , from the <unk> even had to b is a <unk> time .
now , you with a patient , a , could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient having a to give you want by simply reheat the hose in it makes no , to him to shake up .
this is going to rediscover that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that for a few minutes of power has already does that <unk> ourselves from a patient , a bad on this is , and has already does that <unk> ourselves from a patient , a lot better on this is because now , patient having a in a story about his experience .
what records , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that memory of us , the and it 's also for the stories we invent .
but what 's a story i think are these , great moments and end .
and that are very important , and in those nations the end .
now , that <unk> itself alive with his life ever .
it has moments of <unk> , after the other .
and they ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really just they are , in all over .
i mean most of those moments of our lives -- and i have this information about -- you know , who present 's a about three seconds long , which means you know that it in a life about 600 million of there in a month there 's about 600,000 , most of you leave a lane .
most of these are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet they get a kind of the impression that they count to think that what during these moments of <unk> 's our lives .
it 's the limited resource , we use as we 're in the world .
and we 're used to say they would seem to be important , but it 's not the story that <unk> ourselves to we keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the middle of time .
second , from the <unk> even if you get a vacation trip , and the second one week what is good as the first instance , it 's <unk> 's twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's not at for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's better than the <unk> on , because there is no new memory be added .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way , is time , on the variable , a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little difference on this story .
now , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's one , this is making decisions , because if you have a patient who have , the outcomes , we have two <unk> at two different surgeons had , and decide , which he would choose to , it 's the votes of the memory of the less bad news is and this is the surgeon , selected will .
this <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
so we choose not between those experiences . we choose between the glory of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we think about our future does n't usually as painful experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look at you know as a tyranny of <unk> and , you can that <unk> even think more than one that kind of the <unk> even electroencephalogram through experience , that <unk> even do n't need .
i have the impression that if we travel to the very common is that means we make a vacation largely hidden in a little bottle of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of <unk> itself is given .
and when i think about , i think of a holiday on that we a few years ago in antarctica . 've done , which probably the vacation trip was , who i ever had , and i think quite often about the how often i want to share of the hdtv , think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i 've ever seen the folder has opened have to 600 of that i would have another one hour spent .
now , that are three weeks , and that are probably its half hours .
because it seems a disagreement is to give .
now , i like a little extremely deft at , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories , but if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we talk to be ?
so i want to keep them about an experiment here thinking .

now , you the same thing we started going to choose ?
and if you a different on would choose , there a conflict between her two types of ourselves and they got to think about how you this conflict to choose and this is really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think they could have a different answers to get .
why we the hdtv , and choose , we do is a problem that , we do with a choice in the two types of themselves .
now , the two types of ourselves into two words from happiness exists on .
there 's actually two concepts of the lucky , we can use , one per copy themselves .
you can ask : how happy that 's <unk> ourselves ?
and then they would ask : how are happy the littlest moments in spite of <unk> ourselves ?
and they 're all be grateful for times is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , i can be ?
and , the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get from happiness the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the luck of <unk> even asking it 's a very different thing .
this is not about how , happy one person who lives .
it 's kind of how happy or by the person is , for this person about their lives as it .
very different .
everybody knows , those terms not from the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness rather long and screwed anyway , in fact , the way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> ourselves and the average happiness the <unk> itself is the last few years , which is nearly all right , and tries to be , both individual .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , and more than a half million people ask for himself was are about what you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
in the years , we started , about happiness . the two types of myself better .
and the main one lesson , we i 've learned that is they really different .
you know how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not much about how happy , he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
just to you an idea of the correlation of relationships to the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that when you would meet and would tell you , , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size , you know ?
now , you would do something about his greatness all know , but there 's uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you someone to be life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> has you have much uncertainty about how happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is low .
we know something about what that does the <unk> .
we know that money very important goals are very important .
we know that happiness and this is very pleased to be with people , we like , time to spend with people , we like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but it 's dominant .
so if you happiness . the two types of ourselves to maximize want you 're going to the end very different things do .
the implication of the , here i said i is we need to be really do n't think should be a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , another reason , we 're not clear about happiness can think is that we 're not the same time to pay attention when we think of the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question to , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you that question to remember that people in california happy to be if you say in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about this in california to think , think the difference between california and other places , and that difference is say in climate .
now , it turns out to climate 's not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful designs that will decide , as happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful yourself responsible is , you get to the end -- some people might the end to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people , to california are in the hope , happier .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier lives are , because if you think about you 'll end of it will , how awful the weather in ohio and they 'll feel that you , the right decision met .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being thinking , and , i hope you an idea of it gives you , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question you .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks ago on , they mentioned to me that 's a pretty interesting ? right there , this out of this <unk> poll was .
this is something , what you to participate let 's can , because they 're going to a few minutes left of ?
daniel perhaps , safe .
i think , the most astonishing result , that we have the <unk> survey found have is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in terms of happiness . the <unk> itself .
if we look at the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out that , under a year , of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and it 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative sample , under a year , from over 600,000 dollars in the year
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people unhappy , and they are increasingly less happy , the poorer than you can be .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat -- and seen .
and what happens is obvious that money is this , no <unk> you know , but that lack of money one certainly do you know , and we can make this already very clear .
in terms of the other -- the <unk> you get another story .
the more money you earned the high levels is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , entire american now it comes down to live freedom that quest for happiness .
when people that finding take seriously would like it on the head to put all , we think , in terms of sustainability policy , etc .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country is generally a complementary finding out how to take seriously would and based on politics were to make ?
dk : you know , i believe that it for it 's for the role of the <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it right and other countries on it right .
the people are recognizing that they 're going to happiness is you should , when you going to think .
it will be a while , and people will discuss them , if you <unk> explore want or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , so we need to this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending how you think and if you to the <unk> even think or whether you to the <unk> even think .
this is going to influence i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you go , that <unk> the population .
this is i think in the next chart , or two decades of the national be statistics .
now , it seems to this is subject , or should include at the most important political debate going to pursue be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny perhaps .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i is how much so for 10 years online . and my goal for the next decade is it 's easy to make , the reality to rescue , you <unk> to rescue .
i have a plan for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games .
maybe something to kind of time , when you think about how many problems we need to the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced that , if we have the next century on this planet to want to this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that the issue took time , 21 billion hours , as a week .
this appears first maybe something <unk> , again , it , so it to you ca : if we have issues like hungry , or poverty , global conflict and obesity want to solve i think we need to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean , it really seriously .
this is very much right , why i believe that games like this critical for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings of the play catch . he 's going on the players create a camera .
this is one of the classic scars of play , .
if you do n't want gamers are , we think you might be some of them in this picture .
you probably that sense of urgency , a little bit scared , but i focus , very <unk> in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of them here , the top <unk> eyes and the mouths are a sign of teenage optimism . the eyebrows present to surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called clash that epic on .
oh , you know that 's ok . well so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that matter very good news is that you do that would n't know that it does it was possible .
it was almost the imagination .
and if you do it , they 're shocked to keep them to actually something that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's a long instruments in epic victory .
, and it 's what we 're going on millions of faces of <unk> in the planet from the way to , when we have the silos is the next to attacking the face of those , at all individuals against the edge of that epic on .
unfortunately we see more like this face in real life , if we are difficult problems with .
i call it as `` life and i 'll be bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? .
that i 'm going on that i thought that `` life and i 'll be bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti -- in my former head home at berkley , california , where to my ph.d. studying why we 're in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem that many football players .
we think that we 're in the reality is not good are like play .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that heard .
we reach in <unk> i mean , in the context of the motivation , something meaningful to be inspired to work with each other .
if we 're in a <unk> are i think of us , our best they 'll turn them , anytime and immediately be willing to are , you that ability to try so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and the reality , if we fail , if we 're on the barriers , and change , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we are gone forever . we feel threatened , perhaps pretty depressed , frustrated , i know .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , play there 's because it does n't .
and that 's what i as a phd student to look at .
why is what 's play an impossible to think that could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality that ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , collaborative solving it .
and i have some things have noticed that epic wins , <unk> as possible .
so first if you one of online games come into this , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , you 're ready , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , perfectly to her current level of the game with , right ?
so they can do that .
they have no one task , you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , you , you want to try better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you who 's not around and about six months . there 's always very specific something significant to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , engage with you to make their epic mission of business .
that we have in real life , not just that feeling that in a <unk> of employees agreed to stand .
also , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have are lots of `` level up and plus-one strength '' or heard `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did not , which is plus-one talk and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so that the <unk> the world of warcraft is that it quite gratifying it 's in any given the edge of that epic on to stand out that we get our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to , virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to make it 's the context , to see , <unk> million years went in our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright became good primate .
ok , if we talk about , how much time we now with play spend , it 's just make sense when to the time in terms of scale of human decency , are holding me , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that , we the notion that we all this time to play using , actually changing this , what we as people in the able to .
we come to us all think , very much beings .
that 's the truth . that i think .
at once they 've got these interesting bit more than the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , you in school , spend , of the five . grade to the end by the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have this is a complete <unk> , on the young people also know what it means a good poker player , how it 's what they 're in school , learn .
and may have any of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know about his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great for the <unk> that , when we have 10,000 hours and laborious studies of any subject to the 21st century . by spending , we 're going to anybody coming in .
we are so good and to know , to do the most people in the world .
so what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , <unk> .
the big question is , `` what exactly are there 's really good ?
because if you do it out how could we have sort of that had never been there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people , we currently in the world , at least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
that are our <unk> . 500 million people , exceptional , `` what . ''
and the next decade we have another one billion players , exceptional , that is .
if it 's still not heard ,
the games industry that <unk> , energy savings too , and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil comes online to play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , it is what we all these games to anybody coming .
here are the four things that i found . the first thing : <unk> .
ok , imagine that the extreme <unk> ago .

i believe , that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it , worth , it to try to say , right .
players are not sit around .
are masters of spiders and social network builds them .
there 's a lot more interesting that there is to know that we are more like , after we with you 've been playing , even if you that 's gone forever .
the reason is that 's lots of trusting too requires , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that somebody out with us to spend that the rules would be honored to the same , and to the end up for this .
so that controls that we see that grow from going to trust and each other .
a number of them , we build greater understanding social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why , the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week of these , as <unk> .
the reason is , when we play , we are actually have been too hard to work , as if we look at or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings can work if we make hard , where do .
and are always ready , hard to work , right to get .
and eventually epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> epidemic .
here 's a <unk> to get the the right light to the back . you know who are lots of wikipedia , the largest <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the internet , the native americans than about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , one contiguous , the players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , believe that you , as individual can change the world .
and the only problem is that they think , you can drive virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the problem that i to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work great . he looked at , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> .
and that by an economist . he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not as i -- i of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , it makes fact , in the sense player can in <unk> more to get , as in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . you get more valuable feedback and those rewards in games than in real life .
so he says , it is entirely obvious that are more time in the virtual world as the real time to spend .
i agree that first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we have to start to the real world in a game into paintings .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there 's these ancient cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
of these fantastic just google , there 's <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek historian <unk> 're familiar , you might this story . the story about how , and why games invented .
according <unk> were playing games , in <unk> , the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
we think there 's such a great famine , that the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea of his .
the people who suffered none . people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> that <unk> and agreed to a national energy strategy . in one day would eat . the next day would play .
and they were as much in the <unk> <unk> be there play so fascinating these are and us , as , <unk> productivity with you to forget it would that 's nothing to eat out there .
and then the next day would play . and the next day would eat .
and according <unk> they survive so for 18 years that famine , by turning on a day ate ravenously and the next was playing .
as i think that we now play a .
we put these games to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put these games to all due to avoid that the real world not work , everything that in real life does n't quite gratifying it 's and we bring us what we need from the play .
but this must not the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was transmitted to 18 years of famine is not better . decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they did the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner boxes on to a epic adventure to break it .
they were <unk> and the quest for a new home . they were just so many people like it food to survive there and looking up with the rest for an area , they are able .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , later that -- rich if you get the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so i came together scientists recently at the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and by geologists found evidence for a global cooling , almost 20 years we took me , the famine in fact that .
so that of these crazy story of voices .
maybe they actually have their people through play rescued , by definition , for 18 years in games have escaped , and then this intuition , and a lot about the playing with each learned that you , by the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we 're playing since 1994 warcraft .
that was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
i would argue , we 're ready for our own epic game .
so they sent half of your civilization in search for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should it 's that half of us an hour a day with play one , we problems of the real world have solved .
i know , they 'll ask , `` how we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and this is the question i mean work in recent years at the center for the future to exacerbate .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it 's still from , how we 're going to be .
we do n't want to mitigate the future of them to say .
what we want is the future of law .
we want to the best results of the way . and then people to empower them , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic wins , and give people the possibilities , to reach them .
i 'll show you very briefly about three different games , i designed to try to another epic victories in their own future to give yourself .
this is the world without oil .
this game is of 2007 .
it 's an online , for them a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for it 's realistic , and you 'll have real life in fact , without oil life , if you to play register , you tell us , where you live . and then you get <unk> real time the show you , how much oil costs , it 's not there , like food at risk is how to transport increased risk is going to school closed organizations are , whether it uprisings and they have to figure out of how you very real life make , when it 's true if you . and we ask you about to blog , or shot to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 tested . and we have you ever since over the past three years of hysterical .
and i tell you , it was a change .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , because we do it should .
but if you a epic adventure games are and told you get , `` let 's about the oil from .
this is a fascinating , that you go .
you find out how they were going to . most of the players have the game <unk> habits that .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at target and as just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that people , 23 years in the planet left .
this -- called `` global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the call to players , you want to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it `` <unk> '' so they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just crashed , you can save the world .
but in our ladders game , instead of only five people say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food health of security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players who played the game 's eight weeks for .
they found in incredibly creative solutions , you read that , if you `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring the three . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you know the game so , and you come from the world the distinction `` social <unk> '' to end by 2010 .
we 're working with major universities , sub-saharan africa and they invite a social networks are getting better .
we have a comic . we have `` level up '' for <unk> <unk> , sustainability vision and ingenuity .
i want you all invite men , this game with young people to share , the world , <unk> , that benefit of putting together in their own social enterprises to the world to save .
i so let me from the end .
i want you something interesting questions .
what , you think that happens to do next ?
we 've all these fantastic players , we have games that show us , what we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
i hope you to me in that i agree that are human resources are , we 're going to work in real life can use , and games to a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social nets to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we put together in history play games to hang on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i entered the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things sure , that we have every media settings future can create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about to me a few months ago , writing an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i realized , writing , my <unk> our fingertips , but i was with the left of such plans already ready and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have to the disabled , really means .
i read them the post .
`` a '' , `` almighty , `` <unk> , watching helplessly , useless , there 's in , for the wounded , beaten up , <unk> , from <unk> , played , which was stricken , very , who , paralyzed , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from the traffic moved , <unk> , done , broken <unk> to vote , lo and get hurt , or ineffective and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , sensitive .
i have this list of a friend , according to read and had to find laughter , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop , and i do n't you 're going to this <unk> <unk> and the so <unk> emotional shock .
of course , that was a <unk> , old <unk> . i told me just thought that the readout , old .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i just with the school actually started and so began to my self just outside of my family on building and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god 's too much when i do n't <unk>
i would this post take seriously , i would have in a world that someone like me as a person to perceive that their <unk> way we take a kind of it today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expect that i 'm here a <unk> 'll find .
there 's the updating version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
especially to shake me the last two words , `` near <unk> , and healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about , we think about the people think , we do with these words to describe .
it 's about the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values , .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that , you according <unk> , and can manifest .
so what we want to actually manifest -- a said in people or a powerful people ?
just a people <unk> of to call , could be enough , it into and you have <unk> .
it 's not beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a human beings , for me door opened up was my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you to think , most americans do n't counted correctly it could . he was always dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and for the work with kids just like water .
i found the time , to that hospital i spent , just great -- the way to my <unk> .
i had one will seem to make up often do with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- different colors -- that you know how to build my <unk> build . and i have this on down , throughout than anything . i they hated . i do you felt crucified . i they hated it .
and i whistled even been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and trying this exercise to stop , <unk> no success .

and if you get it as if you , i give you a hundred dollars .
it was obviously just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i the exercise will do , i did n't want to do with the prospect that the richest five year-old girl in the ward in the second third floor . but it 's got me in fact that brought together , my daily <unk> with new eyes . it was that spawned a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self being formed , and i i imagine being able to me as a kind of the powerful , powerful and <unk> person .
it 's just an example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination from a way .
but like the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language is no room , to imagine , which we all wish i would say , it every single to themselves , as powerful people .
our language is behind the social changes as no , in many cases , by a technology changes that causes .
the medical contribution from it can course , that my legs , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium dioxide and , hip for ranging from body , it allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the borders , you your natural destiny with trying out to do n't need to one of social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity to what 's own way of ourselves , going to the world , who are choosing , , you choose .
maybe that so this technological change and more because the that it 's always been a different truth gave , which is that every single person in the society something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt , this is an interesting story , because people me , about trying to ask to tell that i thought , against deal and i 'm going to you to confess , this particular sentence , to me never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i can understand , why .
this phrase from of against tremendous family lives of the idea that success or happiness spontaneously on it , a challenge to anybody coming , regardless of the so on top experience this shape . as if my life so successful that would be because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic limb of it was able to , journaling , who let me with my disability as well .
but the truth is we need to change . course , we 're talking about the challenge this shape , no matter whether you physically , emotionally , or , both is
and i would argue that is good .
against tremendous odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> have to have to deal with our lives better clear to come .
gave you 're not just to our lives .
and i tend to think that gave when my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind is sometimes it 's not likely to see , it is constantly struggled with me .
and i do n't want to the effect , or sterility . with the <unk> of people having .
there 's in life , against tremendous and challenges , and they 're just <unk> real and each person is so different speeds . but the question is not to do we gave you come to or , but how we realized that come .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people that we love , <unk> to protect them , but they also to prepare , so clear to come .
and we be our children 's no , if we put them the sense to give you to do n't want to this .
you have to two things that dividing , for one of the fact , an to be and to another that we think about whether i was a 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and an disability , i tell you had is that the world and says , you can take me to the definitions of .
in our desire , people to protect ourselves , us on the heart of manufacturing and you the cold , of truth about their medical a lot to or even a forecast the quality to say , you expect , we have to that we 're not the they allowed to put that somebody actually a result is .
maybe this is in community of the idea that that just paying me , in a broken and how do we fix , for every one to a disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people do n't holistically and treat , and not his evil forces and opportunities are able to acknowledge , we do it in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a human beings , for our society a value .
so we have about the <unk> look out and us on all of human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but this is that 's between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those very challenging the n't cheap , who deny that we should n't try them to avoid , we can give them under the return , but it 's about , the defender retaliates against tremendous opportunity to recognize .
it gets me about perhaps more about that clear to imagine that we gave not necessary to get to , but that we do this is already are , you to hug , and make it really seize and i want to also a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , against perceived as a natural , coherent and useful to see and we are so through their presence , i wo n't like learn tools .
this year , celebrate we 're 200 of the . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , my eyes , on something very true in the human nature of pointing out .
i would it this is : not the most of this species survives , and it 's not the <unk> of itself , but the , changes in the place to create .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability to survive and <unk> , from the fight the human mind is , conflict to turn .
so again change and are the greatest the ability of people .
and maybe you know that we did , for some timber which we ball are , if we really have to .
maybe it 's exactly that the point of adversities , a perception of myself , the sense of our own power .
we can be so even something to .
we can be adversities a new meaning to give the tough times beyond what about .
maybe we can we gave a change .
gave up for a change , of the we still do n't have adapted .
i think , to make the damage , we even done to have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
honestly , -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray matter who really know going to learn when it they really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we that paradigm of normality , another , the opportunity or the strength , it remains , a little bit dangerous to me restate that they could . so we can the forces of very many kids who release , and they 're going to invite men , your very special and those skills in the society in .
<unk> 've figured out found that we humans from the members of our society , of being good time , to be and a contribution to do .
there 's cues on that already the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe and physical injuries related to have worn dozens and it did n't know , because the wisdom in <unk> of people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless at citarella ; they were regarded as something special and those things , treated .
a few years ago , i was the city , when i was raised was , a <unk> in the `` you zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> from .
it was earlier , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well if that 's not who is .
and i turn me to , and see these elders man i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , , we know about us and i ca n't know , you .
and he said , `` well , you one , barely able to remember me .
when i do you the first time , spellbound , they learn from the belly of her mother has taken .
oh , the .
and of course , there 's but then they click done .
that was , dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day know , because i course , quite typical , to my birthday , two weeks to postpone and it .
the doctor , they had diagnostics of my mom was in the holidays , and knew my parents the man that me to the world , and at all .
and because i do without <unk> born , and my feet , you one had and i just a few toes , at that , a few toes into the other foot did it was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news right .
he told me , `` i had to your parents say that you never going to write , and it 's never been inside his reputation would like other children or that you 'll never a completely independent of lead could talk , and since they 've got me simply lying disdained .
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood of practice does n't matter whether i know , one <unk> in the second grade to win if i do with the <unk> in the mermaid parade and <unk> the street was , if i was my transplant fellowship , or a friend of <unk> victories <unk> and he was using these clips to his students to say , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , potential of the human willing .
you can just not enough to point , how critical of defining factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> she went on , he said , `` i learned that kids , if you do n't always propose something i 've got cost , and if you just a little bit of support to get to having children , even leaves , then you can have a lot to achieve .
you see dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as anyone with your cellphone , two different things .

i wanted to come back to help the normal work .
if you me that today , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , and that i 'm not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this in also happen , because i was so many people in the my door opened have , instead of people to face , i cut or me an idea on .
you see it really only one of them for pricing , their forces of manifest can , and they 're going through .
if it 's someone to mine , his own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment a door busts open , you 're for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them in water , and doors to open .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means something on yet , that one is the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential we want , then it ?
in the '60s years was in britain 's a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` streaming <unk> '' the united states that we call that when ; ''
the students to music is it .
and the a student will <unk> harder have to get the better teacher , etc .
you know , about a three months of students with a `` well enough , the top grade , `` well , '' there . it was told them , they were <unk> that you very clever would be . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of course , actually crack it 's a the heart to hear that way around the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only those that still in school , were -- apart from the students , the school got .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed .
you 've been just told that are the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only really profound disability is a broken your mind a spirit , the broken by , has no hope it 's nothing more if it 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
if it , but do , the human spirit in order to support to continue to hope , and other people . around beautiful and <unk> to be then we put our federal forces worked really being a .
if a spirit of these qualities that , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem by saying that one of persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by the me my friend , jacques <unk> told , and the poem called `` the god , the only four words . every child 's not the god the name , not the god the banned , but the god , the only four words that 's better and these are repeated , he says , : come to dance with me .
come to dance with me . thanks .
