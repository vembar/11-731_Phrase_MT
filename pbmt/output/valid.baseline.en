you know , one of the great <unk> the travel and one of your bliss in the <unk> research is common with the people to live , , the old days can remember . your past , the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , you the bitter leaves the plants and taste .
just knowing that <unk> still the milky way to or the importance of myth the oldest on the inuit -- still covered with what are , or that in the himalayas the buddhists , the breath of <unk> tracking , which means basically , and they had a revelation for the physical anthropology on the memory to shout out , that 's the idea that the world in which we live , not in a total of it 's not just as a model of reality , and as a a group of certain ways the veldt adapt that we know , although successfully , many generations of chose .
and of course we share all the same <unk> .
we 'll all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to the <unk> separation of death , engage and thus should it 's not surprise that we have all singing , dancing and and art out .
but it 's the unique vocal cadence , has been choruses of the rhythm of dance in any culture .
and plays it does n't matter whether it 's going to the <unk> in the woods of borneo is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior known in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> the sahara . this is to the colleague , i a month ago in the desert was traveling . or even a <unk> , on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that it , <unk> , one of thinking , other ways to where the earth there .
and this is an idea , , when you think about finding , with just hope that we can .
and form of thousands of the world a net of <unk> and cultural life that the earth <unk> and for i think , the earth as important is how the biological <unk> that you 're a biosphere .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can use that when the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , inspirations -- and experimentation , of the human imagination , since the of being generated by to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's this symbol of all of what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere , wear away , that happened -- this the <unk> -- only with it , a greater our velocity .
not a biologist to another example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species on the brink of extinction are , because it 's just not true . this -- that <unk> <unk> in the area of biodiversity -- is barely able to get to us as <unk> <unk> in the area of cultural diversity is known .
and the so for that is a number of these languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on the earth are 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not just the totality of this vocabulary word or a series of <unk> .
a language is sort of human spirit .
it 's a means , with the soul of a culture has access to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecology of spiritual possibilities .
and of these are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , sit , exactly half of , it in the ears of children <unk> .
they will these infants do n't even more about teaching . that is , if nothing is being done , they 're actually been dead .
what might be lonely when the silence <unk> to be one of your people to be , your language to talk , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors to share , or the hope that children to expect ?
and yet given this horrible epidemic of fact , somebody somewhere on earth , about . all because of dying of an old man and take the last <unk> an old language with the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better than that ? would be the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say , '' well , let this language yoruba . let them <unk> .
let them kogi does ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it would be if you get your own language not could talk .
so i want you today of , on a voyage through <unk> take , a short journey through <unk> , to try to you get to me , actually been lost .
now there 's some of us , the way that i , if i say `` different ways of being that really different ways of being mean .
they take for instance , this kid on the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people , the anaconda , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east and the belly of latter-day saints snakes <unk> .
this is a seafaring people , which is not being cognitively far between the colors blue , and green is , because the <unk> the forest that the people would be to <unk> is .
they have a dip to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , that one another language to speak .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear to sort of big houses , which , because of the <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , but what is that you 've never catching somebody said , a brain learns language .
they just hear , and begin to happen to talk .
or , one of the controversial tribes , where i ever lived in the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first , in 1958 , peaceful and contact .
in 1957 , trying to five missionaries with lots and did a created some mistakes .
they threw a little shots of the thousands of the air down , we as kind gesture is what would . and forgetting that these people from the rainforest in her still never be something <unk> had seen .
they did these photographs from the ground on , trying behind the face or the figure to see n't find , concluding that this business of the devil , and killing the five missionaries with the spear .
but the <unk> killing not only be with the spear .
they <unk> other .
54 percent of deaths were happening through <unk> .
so we were the <unk> eight generations go back and found two cases of natural death and when we the people with saying something about <unk> , you gave to that one of the people that old it was that he 's based on his age died , and we were killing him still with the spear .
but at they had a clear you or the forest , the amazing .
they were hunters who were the urine of an animal coming from 40 up of the smell and determine , which species that was .
in the early <unk> years i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor at harvard in said , if i used to be interested to have to go and the secret societies to infiltrate , the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the deadliest venom , that this was used to look at to make sure .
to this sensation having a to make sense , i had to say , something about this really believe in the <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the contrary , it 's see , a complex metaphysical way .
it 's interesting .
if i ask you would the great world 's such , they would say ?
christianity , islam , practicing buddhism , <unk> or whatever .

but <unk> so interesting is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
so the living bear the spirits .
the spirit people can of the threat of water of evoking be the answers on the rhythm of dance , the soul of living for the day out to , is why the <unk> for just a shiny moment , god will .
they had to say the <unk> like , `` you white is going to the church and you talk about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and be able to god .
and because you 've been obsessed me you get rid of the mind that . how can you damage had done to be ?
you see these amazing -- demonstrations , <unk> in a trance had to the red coal , burning <unk> , an amazing sort of the ability of mind the body like this to influence that it <unk> , if it in a state of the extremes that heightened state and then they will .
now , of all people , i 've met , was the kogi from the sierra de santa <unk> in <unk> , most exceptional .
around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> coastal from colombia world and a result of conquest moved , that people in a <unk> volcanic shield can , that over the <unk> coastal there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people the only , never have of the <unk> conquered .
to the day now , you from a ritual that priesthood is king . training to a priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> to age three , and four years of their families and for in a <unk> world of the dark , <unk> the high life the glacier 's for 18 years by that . two periods of at nine years , you 're elected , about nine months of pregnancy , our smile , they in which of her mother had spent , you spend now <unk> in which one of the mother .
and during this whole time , they become a cultural shortcomings in the charges your society in place . values , the claim that , that their prayer and just their prayer , cosmic web -- or we could say the ecological puzzle -- that sustain .

it 's wonderful . you have it to protect .
they call the older brother and say that we , we the younger brother who are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we , then the landscape think conjure up , either <unk> and the old who the fancy wild up , which in his simplification of a <unk> idea is or other thoreau and say these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , then aboriginal communities are n't sentimental , you 'll end of nostalgia compromised .
it 's not a lot of room for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold wriggle around from tibet , but you have yet , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , not on the idea is based , you 're close to be , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth , only exist because you the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , that mean ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the think up knowing that the mountain becomes a <unk> is the moment , or her destiny to determine , is a very another person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or in that have , as a little girl from montana , in the think up knowing that a mountain that 's a bunch of stone is the away , can be .
if he 's a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia , and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> .
it made me to a different people as my friends in the <unk> , believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> minds are , the <unk> the world to live in the spirits , you look at their <unk> can be .
now , you begin to the idea to look at that these cultures and realities of the model can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . , these plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon on .
this is an ayahuasca , by a lot of you 've heard , the most powerful these sorts of preparation for the repertoire of the shamans live .
what an ayahuasca so fascinating is not just the <unk> kind of this <unk> , but of processing . it will actually from two different sources that . on the one , there 's this wooden <unk> , a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , some hallucinogenic , to . this <unk> by taking that 's about that as if , a blue <unk> smoke in their minds put , it will come , the leaves of <unk> from the family of the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
these plant matter contains some very strong <unk> the front of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you , the <unk> 've been working , this stuff found themselves , this compound , you from different ways that 's also <unk> .
this <unk> to themselves that 's about that like from a <unk> at it , <unk> of the baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man that the psychedelic <unk> with the discoveries of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years started talking about being discussed . i said that you these <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic categorize it was okay , in the moment in the you the implications of that , it 's frost-nixon , to have a <unk> to learn .
but the thing with <unk> is the fact that you 're not from your be obtained can actually , because you through a in the human bowels of course <unk> enzyme genes with names <unk> , <unk> .
you can only connection with a different chemicals from your be obtained , the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> of these are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , is necessary , the <unk> to <unk> . you 're wondering , so itself .
how can these people from one , flora by 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically just not related to plant the world , this way , combined , sort of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of parts is ?
we use these great euphemism for , trial and error , to be meaningless -- turns out .
but you have to ask the indians do they say , `` for the talks to us .
now , which means that ?
this tribe , <unk> , 17 different varieties of an ayahuasca , they all the great distance in the fact , for our eyes of as the things .
and then ask you know how they taxonomy arguably , and they say , i thought you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at ? '' and i said , `` no .
so it turns out to you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> take and they sing , they come in a different modulate .
now , that does n't give them a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
now , that <unk> that is that even those of us , and sympathy had to the hard to the native americans have to bring them as <unk> and colorful , you know , but if you kind of the past to during the world , which is our world , progresses .
so , in fact is , you that , 20th century . , 300 years not for his righteous war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than thinking of an era , we <unk> , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth 's either take action support his or becoming passive with . that 's not the change .
all cultures have again , at the dance with new <unk> involved .
and that 's not the technology .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when you must bow and will switch tasks , when the american who stopped americans , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it 's . it could face the rule .
and , you , the world <unk> that will discover that these cultures are not the crashing of <unk> are . this dynamically and uncontacted peoples , whose existence through some very much going to talk about their capacity of the veldt adapt to go out . it , and the for health of deforestation in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a people that , one generation freely in the forest that lived , and now to <unk> and prostitution , the river in the fact , where you can see that even the river with the mud polluted by going to the almost half of borneo in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . from where the japanese <unk> at it to see are , are willing to their <unk> with a raw <unk> to fill , you the forest that away . or as in the case of the <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we 're in the mountains of tibet go , where i recently a study , you will be that could face the political dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of nights , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of the people will not just not of nights , but generally and <unk> in a <unk> celebrated .
and you can take the suffering tibetan n't understand that if you do n't it on <unk> level have seen .
i kept traveling even with a young artist colleagues got 6,000 miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and only when i want to <unk> and i saw the face the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble , and then volcanic ash into detail . 1.2 million people , during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .
the father watched this young boy has grown man was as followers are the <unk> lama and there .
that meant that he received during the chinese it immediately get killed .
his uncle '' bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , people to nepal and it .
his mother was locked up , as punishment to -- for the crime as straightforward .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to do it , under your <unk> to hide , because without it 's not life could .
the sister , these <unk> did <unk> , what a <unk> to .
one day , it turns out on them on a mean around and this , the <unk> had them for seven years in a hard labor camps .
the suffering tibetan plateau soil can become intolerable -- but the <unk> spirit of the people 's something <unk> .
and end we are really , a choice . we want in a <unk> the technologized world 's or a <unk> world of the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , great good anthropologist who said before they died , that it 's their greatest fear is because , we us towards a thread , <unk> , generic at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of the human imagination , of an <unk> way to fly would see , but that we have one day from a dream up , and i 've forgotten , that it 's any other possibilities that there .
and it 's very humbling the idea that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , that agriculture and essentially , and us that moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , poetry of the shaman said , by the purple prose the priesthood carriage , and hierarchy , urging me and labor surplus created -- and an hour ago , just 10,000 years .
and the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers to the challenges have , which we 're in the next few millennia to stand .
if we those thousands of <unk> after the importance of the human answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and this song we 're going to the possibility to rediscover that what we are , people to run into consciousness has bucked the importance are aware that all humans and it 's a room are able to <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
there 's a photo that i just the northern tip of the end <unk> on , when i do with <unk> in <unk> went . and this man <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his favorite number .
the government is not always very well with the inuit -- going and during the <unk> years of establishment of the rule , they forced me , settlements to .
the granddaddy of this old man who refused .
the family , afraid to be life took him all , all the tools .
now you have n't know , the inuit -- not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .

the granddaddy of the man was afraid , not the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> outside , , and his pants off from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and when the matter hits the market started shaped , he in the one win .
he <unk> saliva , the pages <unk> and when it are frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .

so you come from nothing to do something .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous the world .
the government had the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control of an area , that 's bigger than california , texas .
it 's our new home country and is <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , one nation , state , atoning with its people , and it .
and eventually i think it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the planet went out there are , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent pieces of the human imagination , in times past back . and for all of us , the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we at national geographic and try is that we believe that politicians will never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not economic case is , but we believe that storytelling in the world can and so we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million popular ones transmitted every month .
156 nations are sending our tv .
our science magazines , billions of millions of reading .
and we are a series of travel in the <unk> , which we take our audience to places of such as cultural ask me take you to get rid of the foot you blinding passers by and hopefully , they become one after the other the central revelation for the physical anthropology on one : that this world 's made in various ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , and the wisdom of all people to our shared comfort they can contribute .
thank you .

we see , lots of gigabytes of digital photographs here , you will seamlessly , and that <unk> , pan , in any way to make arrangements .
and it 's how many of information that we look , how large that collections of these are or how big the images .
most of you 're using digital shot a camera , but this is , for a scan of the congress and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only to the performance of a system like this is cut it 's the number of a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . any quote is a chapter .
to prove that it , to a text and not to a picture is , we can do something about how do that , to really show that an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would n't recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a section .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , we will , sort of the medium with several scales .
we 've also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high pressures which are designed , much higher than in a normal this is and we have more content added .
if you the features of cars look like , you can see here .
or different models , or , technical specifications .
, and she really these ideas on , these constraints , it 's available for the screen to stop .
we hope that 's not pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- this should n't be necessary .
of course , this is mapping then one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want to this really not much spend time , except that , we also to this area that are .
but that are all roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
, let 's now something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . it can <unk> .
this is a project with the name photosynth , that for two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> , noah <unk> , a university students , the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> of the <unk>
and rick <unk> from microsoft i 've done a very good working together .
so this in this the internet . it from <unk> by .
you can see that , when we have these kinds of views of the model , where we by images through , and this experience the data which is done .
but the spatial can still be the images here is actually , of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together lasted for you to the real space , of these images , the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies were made , equal . you see here elements of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with the limit .
i do n't know exactly , if i still time i do you different environments to show .
there 's what , a lot to be spatialized to .
i 'd like straight one of the original pieces of noah needed to show and this is by an early prototype of photosynth , the we first time in summer 've been working to that you try to show , what i believe that it really the punch behind this technology , the <unk> and this is not so obviously if you have the environments at , we the website .
we had to come for the lawyers , and so concerned about .
this is a scan done the cathedral to notre dame , the only in the computer with images from flickr from its inception . give you just going to notre lady , flickr , and they 're taking pictures of men in a t-shirt , and on the <unk> etc . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> discovered .
so they 're this all <unk> , and they all stand in this way in relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way through .
. you know , i never believed that i ended up at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the inmates had this .
. i suspect , you can see that 's part of different kinds of these are , and it comes from the <unk> to do it <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment me .
and if you can i 'm going to some of the strange .
many of you 're kind of their faces by so forth .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually is a of notre dame , the right recorded .
we can get rid of the poster to a physical view this environment .
the point here is that we do things with the social environment of do it will now data from all held -- of the whole collective of memory of like , visually the planet looks -- and everything is going to each other .
all these photographs are connected to and there 's something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth is born .
at them this as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and it 's something that by the complexity , with the people using it , growing , to use for the user interface with the application and bigger than is .
their own photos to metadata <unk> , one another person on .
if , somebody the trouble has done and this kind of them , and he becomes , who they 're all , my picture of the notre <unk> suddenly with this data that way , and i can you want to point , in this space to come , these <unk> , the photos of other people use and so one of sounds far <unk> social experience with the use of other players doing .
and of course , as all of the people are immense amounts of the rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , not only by <unk> or from satellite and further and there were , but through collective memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to to a certain point , in the next few years , all images , of someone in the world together to be used in principle to be related to be ?
yes . it does not different than to discover .
if you want is made them to hyperlinks between the images .
and they do this based on the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , when you the amount of the semantic information and i think , many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they are input and the text of the of thousands of information about what 's a picture that 's .
but what about it , if that image you with their pictures connecting ?
then is the amount of the semantic <unk> and the amount , it basically , really enormous . it is a classic <unk> .
<unk> , it 's really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to them some things from my book about the edge , i hope , with other things are the they have heard . and i 'm trying to myself a couple of connections to create , that you 're not have noticed .
i want to start thinking , i `` official dogma '' call .
the official dogma of what ?
and the <unk> of all western industrialized world where societies .
the official dogma in it 's in that if our goal of this to maximize the common vision for the citizens who is about this is , through <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reason is that freedom , is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people continually freedom have , it 's all of us for yourself , the things to do , our common good maximize returns and nobody has to us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize returns .
the more choices that people have , more the freedom , and the more and they have , the more common good , you .
this is i think so deep in our water ones that 's not in the sense would come it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply embedded in our lives runs .
i 'm going to them some examples of that give to us modern progress that controls .
this is my supermarket . not .
i want to just briefly about a little <unk> say .

this is how the supermarket .
and they go the <unk> business plan to a good stereo at an hour -- and speakers , <unk> , a <unk> radio are . and in this one of electronics is there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> reason why i put together , from the components , in this one store are offered .
they must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i was a boy was , there was possible to every phone vendor , you wanted , as he , ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . there 's not <unk>
a consequence of it was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite , choice , phones , especially in the mobile phones .
that are the mobile the future .

and they should that until now , not in your business have seen , you can be sure that it 's going to be .
and what it does it 's going to help people to in the business to walk and this to question .
you know now what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no .
it 's not possible a phone to buy that 's not too much to do .
in other aspects of life , very much more important than that buy one of personify things are , but of the same kind of explosion of choices to .
health -- it 's got no longer the case in the united states that you need , you go and the doctor says you to do something .
instead , they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says you , we could be a to make or we could be doing .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and doctor , to do ? ''
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , you know what would you do ?
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you .
the result is -- we call it patient autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but the reality is a shift in the burden of the responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone to know -- namely the doctor , to somebody on the n't know , and most probably sick and it 's why not in the best constitution , is a choice to make -- namely the patient .
there 's such a marketing examples of prescription medication available for people like you and i said , that , if you think about does n't make sense of power , because they do n't buy .
why do gears for them to us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is they sort of us the doctor across the next morning , call and to a change in the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide you .
we 'd not as we invent it .
and we make us so many new , how we want .
this means that every day when you look at the following morning , they have to decide what kind of the person you wish to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there 's a time , the <unk> was that almost every one had and that it as fast were married soon as they were and so fast enough to get as you could .
the only true election was `` who '' , when , and not what they do , we did .
nowadays everything is just have them .
i teach at the intelligent , students and i 'll give you 20 percent less work when i used to be doing .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they performing , carefully .
it 's because they do with other things too are , you ask yourself , `` i have to marry , or not do i 'm going to marry ?
i later to marry ? should i just have kids , or just to have a career ?
that are all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions regardless of whether it does all the in to do that i do you made and a bad grade in my headed to get one .
and in fact , you should do that . this is important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl that with the technology that enables us to every minute of every day from any place in the planet to work -- the way to the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , i 'm not going to you in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to do n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this incredible freedom of the choice we have in terms of work to make informed decisions , and again , and if we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children with the football games are watching , and we have our mobile phone in a hip , and our blackberry , other hip , and our laptop , on our lap .
and also if you all off are , every minute , we our child with the real of a soccer watching we 're also , `` i tried to this call would ?
i should be in this email back ? i should that letter writing ?
and even though , the answer to the question `` no , '' is it certainly affecting their experience of <unk> their children 's define very different than it would have been .
so where we look , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there 's some of choices , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world in the now we live looks like this .
and the question is are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what good at this , so i 'm about what i think about it is .
all these choices have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he this is to free .
and so many options out of you pick it people very hard to do need to decide .
i 'm going to them , another <unk> example of giving a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague of thing i had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and i think about . 2000 different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the largest employer offered , in the two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> , 10 percent less and people taking part when you 're only 10 to offer to fall .
because it 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to that you , it on tomorrow , till you .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
do that 's not just means that people <unk> to eat when you the retirement go , because they 're not enough money for them on have , it also means that make this hard is that you , big <unk> your employers who miss .
through not participating in give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the future employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis , is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it makes for that the world looks like this .
they like the decision really make , if it for all eternity is right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund to vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even when we the lesion overcome pettiness and make a decision , and that we need less happy with the result of the selection , as , if we have the opportunity had to us between a few ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is for us through large selection of <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect imitation ? it 's easy to figure out of them as a different decision to have enough to make the better would have been . and what happens is this sort of an imagined alternative to them to the decision to regret , and that we regret that on in happiness , you of both in that we had , even if it 's a good choice .
the more opportunities there 's , the simple is it does nothing to regret that 's get there for the choice that they meet .
secondly , economists <unk> .
dan gilbert 's a big point morning is made by he told as a lot of the way , we evaluate things , on it to what we do it 's conceivable .
well , when it 's a lot of alternatives to think there , it 's easy , attractive of one of alternatives , they exclude them , that makes them less happy with the alternatives , they voted .
here 's an example . for the of them , no new york are , sorry i .
but here is what they have thought should .
here 's a few days , the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . great day . there 's all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' and the husband thinking , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could directly in my house in park .
and he spend two weeks of the thought of that he 's a possibility of missed one day , one day be a lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , we go through our choice as well , if that what we chose to have been fantastic .
and the more ways it to choose from there , the more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> into account .
here is another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the right up to live and maybe about things are slow to do .
but an important point , he does this is always searching who do for one thing they decide , other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of an attractive properties have , and it is , they 're going to do is less powerful .
three : the escalation of the expectations .
this , i met , when i was my jeans they wanted .
i 'm dressed me , almost all the time .
and there 's a time in the it just designer jeans a way that there , and they have you bought , and they 're bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough , and often enough clean did n't know , they started , `` okay '' <unk> .
so i went to create new me to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size .
and the guy said , `` you want to appear to easily <unk> or of ?
you want to do buttons or the zippered ? rock or an acid would clean sheets ?
you want to me with holes ?
you want to the bottom , cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding afterward , i said , `` i 'd like the way , in the only way . ''
he had no idea that was , i spent an hour with all these up with me <unk> , and off the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me , i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better .
but i felt bad .
what i wrote a whole book to try it to myself in origin .
the reason for that i got felt was , with those who are , my expectations for me , for a few jeans is , went up .
i was very low expectations . i did n't let 's expectations , when it you just a way that there .
when you a hundred species came , damn well , one of you 'd be perfect it
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and i compared to what i have had to the what i expected , and what i do was there in comparison to the what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in the lives of people increases is the expectations of the people have about how well these opportunities to be .
and this gets to less great satisfaction with the results , the results .
nobody in the world of marketing manager knows because , if you know it would say , you know what they all do n't it what do is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything worse was , than anything worse was , it was for the people can see these things to make the a surprise .
now , the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , one citizens with one than expecting -- the best for that you ever greater hope it is that , things are good at how to it of you expect .
they 'll never have been surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to -- -- that 's what they all came out there are -- the secret to -- are low expectations .
i want to say -- a <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman married and it 's really wonderful .
i have it does n't do better . i did n't get settled .
but settle on this is not , a bad thing .

if hundreds of different kinds of me are available , and they buy one that there is , you ask why , who 's in ?
it 's also clear that answer to the question is it .
they have it can do .
with a hundred different kinds of me in the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and , when people make decisions , and even though , the decisions are good , feel keenly disappointed about you 're blaming themselves .
clinical depression is an exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a pretty whopping -- not the only but a pretty whopping <unk> to this explosion of the cost , and committing suicide , is that people who 've learned that there are because their so that high and then , if you these experiences of ourselves to have to you think it would your fault .
and it 's <unk> that it 's generally better is about an objective , we see bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma for that one that we all for us really think , completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no question that a choice is better than any weakness , but it is not enough , the more choice is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what this is .
i 'm pretty sure that we do that have missed , the variety of our common good way .
now , as a policy question -- i am almost done -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking that what all these choices to be sitting in the industrialized world where societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of many of you 've heard , the problem is not the way to be large selection is .
your problem is that you to little bit .
so the things about the i 'm telling you 're an odd thing with the modern , rich , western societies .
and what is frustrating and on this is steve levitt would have you briefly yesterday about it about how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that this very expensive , complicated patient making -- it 's not just that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they 're going into that we are standing there .
if something of what the people in our society that controls this to make informed decisions to the societies in which people of a choice 've shifted that would not just the lives of people increases , but we would also be improved .
economists call this a <unk> amazed .
<unk> is that make that everybody 's better go , not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us an .
and finally , read you this cartoon , and , a sophisticated , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it possible in this <unk> .
they include imagination , a shortsighted , the world -- and that 's the way it as i 'm going to read i .
the more of but i thought about , the more i came to an example , that the fish to know .
because the truth is , if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , you have n't give freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that can do anything is lower it 's the average happiness .
they increase of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with the part of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely upward for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for of suburbia , and , i suspect a catastrophe .
you very much .
you know , i think about some of these projects have been talking , about the human genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start to learn from a new point , we have the biology digitized , and now we try to the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life make and to .
we 've always trying to be meaningful and ask questions .
what 's life ? it 's something that 's what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand the one on different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it to the minimum components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced it was the transition from the analog world of biology to augment digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live can be replenished ; or whether we new life make it can figure out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species has the time , in there will replicate it and we 've tried to do it with a still have smaller genome -- you can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up from the 500 or so , here .
but if we were those metabolic map at , very simple is , compared to our . trust me , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we all those genes at the , one after the other them to it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell lead to fall .
so we 've decided that 's the only way forward , is that chromosome in fact to synthesize that allows us the single component of to <unk> and some of the fundamental and ask questions .
and we started to deal with the question , we can a chromosome synthesize several ?
what it 's the chemistry of these really big molecule to build this is still never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome is the way to just a piece <unk> where fissionable material .
our steps in the very high-res digitization of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly that , but still turn up . and our final point was now , of an exponential curve .
we 've got 15 years ago started doing this .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review before we get the first experiments that made .
like , turned out there 's <unk> very difficult .
there 's tens of around the world 's the little pieces of dna can make , 30 to 50 letters , but it 's a <unk> process , the longer you a piece of the more error happen .
so we had a new way to come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus on the bacteria can kill .
so we made and pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting to phase , when we do this piece <unk> we took and a bacteria , and the bacteria in the genetic code , and viral particles .
the viral them were then the cells to give and came back and killing the chuck e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> , and they said that they this model just figure out .
they laughed more than their it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software standards , the your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted it , a lot go further . we wanted a whole <unk> chromosome ; building . it has more than <unk> of genetic code . so we thought of us , we 're putting it it on the size of the virus is what we , the size it on <unk> able to understand what the single component of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in the computer will want to these digital access information that way .
when we have the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that 's used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of design it 's pieces to the types of letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap have to the smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique species of here in it .
you may have heard that we <unk> into .
, they think about : we have a <unk> code : a , g and t , .
<unk> of letters -- these letters that 's about 20 amino acids , and there 's a single one of what matters for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
so many people who were being that 's not enjoy poetry .
we have the pieces as a mockup that we 're just with an enzyme piece of them were . there are enzymes are the this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of five to <unk> letters in terms , added these spectral line up to <unk> to make this time of the back into , to <unk> .
in every step we have these pieces at the surplus is able to sequence them were because we tried a very robust process to create what you a minute to see .
we 've tried to point of the <unk> to universal .
so this is sort of like a <unk> .
if we need to these really great happiness spontaneously rises to get -- with over 100,000 base -- then to this is not just in the chuck e. coli that grow . it adds up all of modern molecular biology . and went to other plastic mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of the <unk> recombinations is called , the biology is used to disrupt dna fix , these pieces together .
here 's an example of it . there 's an organism 's called <unk> <unk> the three million wheel , radiation perfectly fine .
you see in the upper field to be larger chromosome just really just drops .
12 to 24 hours later , it all over again so uneasily together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can totally parched be , they can even in a vacuum .
i am totally certain extent to live in space that go and move , on the search for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used -- actually we 've just <unk> used with the right design the pieces we have it <unk> . yeast and so these then automatically join together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule that we do it even with the <unk> can see .
this is that footage of a whole duration of six seconds .
this is the read that we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters of the genetic code . it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we 's a <unk> , and without distances of print it would it would <unk> pages from just to this genetic code print .
now , how we turn on a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that 's a virus very straightforward . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it is as much easier if you . <unk> how we 're doing , you just take the nucleus out and there is a different in here , and that 's exactly what they all about the idea of about .
in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell into but recently , that , when you have a complete transplant of the chromosome from one cell to another that can make and these are .
we they were the chromosome one <unk> . speaking , these two as far from how humans , mice . we gave some <unk> to try to this pair chromosome choose to praise . we <unk> 's piece of the rest of misfolded protein to destroy . and it was very amazing when we do it 's a cell gave -- and they 're going to our very <unk> 's perspective here to estimate --
this new synthetic chromosome in to cell .
in fact , we thought that 's the end is , but we 've tried the process of a little further and safety .
this is the <unk> of the here .
we find all sorts of species here , a second chromosome in fact , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of one in just a second a keystone species <unk> .
people see the evolution of the way as a gene that 's going to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology missed .
there 's enzymes are the <unk> be called the fact , dna digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we put them have already .

it goes , blue because of the genes that we put them .
and after a very short time , it was all the characteristics of the species forever lost and converted completely in a new species of based on the new software that we in the cell made .
all these proteins and changed the membranes and changed , -- when we the genetic code to read , it was that 's exactly what we 're transferring aid .
it sounds like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by the way we <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
so i argues that 's not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argues that we possibly use that are a new form of the cambrian explosion , i want to create the case , it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital design can be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are in the of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
and it in my connection to ask : i was in 1946 born .
today are three people on this planet for each of the , in 1946 there 's ; within of 40 years to do it 's four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , their fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion for every oil . that 's a hundred million every day of .
when we think of biological processes are thinking or some process of the self to replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then there 's the co2 from this material that the end up .
we 've now , from our discoveries from the world , a database , to talk about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and , look at the diversity of the it was .
we hit here 's first line to the limits the biological reality , and that our imagination .
we 've now technologies , because of these rapid <unk> , to do that what we <unk> genetics .
we have now , the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes the day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million distinct flavors of genes to produce or these redundant processes to sort of octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team , biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can to the viability <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of that 's really <unk> , we 're working with the reason , actually sit down and new species on your computer to design <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
what we are now , switch fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn and run ethanol seen what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon drowned out to the much higher <unk> have to tell , octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think the only way to convince biology is a big impact , another spike in the cost on food or the disappointment of the availability that will have is , if we added co2 as starting material can see , and so we 're working on cells that 's path ,
and we think that we get the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that story about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 we 're a method --
but -- in our discoveries of the world , we all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
it lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , to the water <unk> .
it 's co2 in the methane to under the use of hydrogen as energy .

in a very short four-year time we think we could be in , be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we have really -- <unk> goals , ample substitute the petrochemical industry . right . if you ca n't that ted , i could do , where else ? a number of the energy use .
but as we 're working at this , the same approaches to the vaccines to use .
they have it this year with the flu seen , we 're always a year went back up and have a dollar of a support the subject of the right lasts all about .
i think that changed can be , by <unk> vaccines around in advance ; .
that 's like the future , possibly could look with changes , can now the <unk> up to do bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we are light years of the people to improve . our goal is it 's only that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
in the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i come back to get to tell you like the machine works .
now it 's so here . and for all the one that was n't there were , the lhc is the biggest increase science experiment that ever woke up with was 27 more miles in diameter .
his job it 's the conditions are creating , which fewer than a one in a second , the universe that time -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below , geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in detectors on .
at that i work . he called , an atlas off the detector , of feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the structure that you to the scale .
the 10 . september last year was the machine is the first time .
and this picture was from an atlas .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the whole way to the lhc <unk> , to deal with a lot of the lhc <unk> to do a rain of particles in the detector many times .
in other words , as we took this the 10 . 9/11 , we knew that the machine works , a huge victory .
i do n't know that this the biggest <unk> generated , or , when someone the google side to mit and the front page that found .
it means that we have a cultural shortcomings of the science , .
about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine that with these wired shut down here to do was -- this golden wires here .
those wires run <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> it .
now , engineers of you will you look at and say `` no that they do n't . that little piano wires .
you can that contribute , because if you very far made cold , you to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between stars , can make those wires cross the tension endurance .
in the connections between ngos , about <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so hot , the wires are and <unk> <unk> away all of times resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is still a wonderful when you imagine the magnets used over 20 tons drop down and , to care about . 30 inches else .
we were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they <unk> you .
you , they 're all back on their way back .
against the march , the lhc switches back <unk> .
we 're going to him turn , and to follow the first data in june , july , trying to have , and put our journey on , to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
now on a kind of controversy , these accidents to the debate going to extract value of the science and <unk> of these borders . it 's something that it down .
i think about the fact that 's so hard is the fact that we have about our what extends beyond your grasp , is perceived value of the things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my closing those words in english scientist to their own , humphrey davy , the edge , i suspect , when he was the deeply in experiments of his <unk> defended itself , his student was michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is dangerous for the evolution of the human spirit , as to assume that our scientific and have lights out there are that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to seize that there .
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books and writing is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , life in love and fascination .
and i do n't expect that the ever will change .
it 's recent ones that is in my life and my career on that to make me to my to this is a completely to rethink .

result is that i said , do n't matter where i come , for me vilified as if i the crashing of <unk> .
seriously -- the crashing of <unk> .
for example , they can get very concerned to me and say , `` if you are not that you , this success never went to be ?
they have no longer afraid of that they all their lives in order and never again a book , that anybody in the world in case ? never again ? ''
okay , that makes it turns out .
it would be however much worse , if i do n't remember this was going to come over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , the first time of them told me to a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced am .
the people said , `` did you not afraid , never been to have ?
you ai n't afraid that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you ai n't afraid you to the craft and your life , <unk> and it never challenged to come up and that you on a <unk> <unk> dream is going to die -- your mouth crusted with the bitter dregs of ash of failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer , these questions is <unk>
i 'm afraid of all those things .
and that i had always .
and i ago , a lot more things are scared , nobody can get a dignity .
like this -- and other <unk> things .
but if it 's about writing about how i think for a true about it and i wonder : why ?
it 's about ?
it is that of someone who are expected to change that he was afraid of the work to do the he proved to get to feel ?
and what exactly the creative enterprises that it 's not about the advent of the mental do -- a way , how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for instance , was a chemist and i can , no , 40 years as a chemist who was doing , he was asked to 's greatest fear that would have a chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how 's you that ?
it was just not ago , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist who have about the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people still .
we who seem but this kind of a range , but not just the writers , but the creative of genres , i see this call them to have , mentally 's unstable .
everything , they have to do , is the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the , 20th century . see , young and a lot of their own hand died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> appalling , tracks from their talents that point was being inadequate .
norman <unk> said in a he died in his last one interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary things that you about her life can make .
but we shrug our n't even , when we have someone like to you hear , because of these statements for so long time you know . somehow we have the notion that she moved and collective accepted that creativity and tired of course always talk and that art -- the back -- always to <unk> .
the question , today i mean that 's imagine i want is is this idea for them , in order ?
, it comfortable with ? because with only one inch by looking at -- i feel with this notion do not comfortable .
i think they become really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't see , the next century , it will .
i think it 's better , if we of creative encourage them to live .
and i know definitely , that it for me -- my particular situation -- very dangerous to build this dark path of a hunch , <unk> , especially in the fact , i fell in my career , i am .
that is -- you see , i 'm pretty well . i 'm just ca n't know , 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , i of indian now going to write out of the world as the work they will , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it 's talk , because we 're here , yes now all of friends -- it 's most likely that one of my success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that are the kind of thoughts , who are going to be able to feed nine o'clock in the morning to build <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i 'd better to continue this work do , i love .
so is the question : how ?
after a period of the <unk> me like that i wanted to continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological ones are building design must .
somehow i have to from now on a way to write a safe distance to right between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction to that 's not going to be .
as i was in the last year after study models for bothered to do that , i also in the past , for and i was trying to other societies have to find , to see if you might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we , as creative help with the emotional risks to deal , with creativity to them .
this for led me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please , follow me , for the circle going to go back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people did n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity of that 's divinely <unk> was , the one of a distant ancestry , unfamiliar , source to the people coming -- from the reason , unknown things .
the greeks called these two divine <unk> the creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that he 's believed , he had one <unk> , and wisdom from further into telling them .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
this is great . roman did n't really that 's a genius a very clever individual .
they believed that 's a genius with this magical about anything divine beings who was that we did was that it literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- it 's about how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in the work of invisible <unk> and the result of their dignity .
that 's brilliant -- it 's there 's the distance , i was like that -- who are building , you look at the follow your work to protect .
and everybody knew , that it worked , right ?
the artists of <unk> was a certain things done , like , for instance , too much to <unk> , right ?

if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your own genius was something <unk> .
so , people in the west really long time about creativity thought .
and then the renaissance and all changed we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let 's the individual attains the center of the universe imagine -- of the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , defenses are creatures , the commands by the divine .
it 's the dawn of rational idea of humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely off the own individual who came .
the first time in the history you hear people who , or some of artists became a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of naked person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like that 's what the pelvis and the essence , the source of divinity , creative , with unknown , an mystery is a little bit of responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how to ask anybody to the sun to swallow .


and , on that -- and i think it 's true -- is the question :
do we change ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can that <unk> from 500 years rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk you have killed .
and there 's certainly affecting people in this audience , really fair science to register it would take over the idea of -- essentially , <unk> , who follow and <unk> on their projects , and so how to work .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey , can take away .
but the question , i kinds want is why not ?
why not about ?
because it as much sense how it from the i heard , when it 's about , absolutely crazy <unk> capriciousness the creative process to understand .
a process , -- like everybody knows that 's ever tried to do -- so in other words : actually , here -- not always about is .
so really , he can sometimes , literally <unk> feel .
i had recently a sense to encounter i did when the extraordinary american beat poet is replacing the stone met , well over 90 is , but her entire life for a poet . they told me that you , when you in <unk> virginia up out on the fields work on . they said , they would feel and can hear like a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from air
the country , they <unk> would .
they felt that if it came , because it would be part of the dirt beneath her feet , <unk> bring .
they knew that , in fact that moment is only one could do . and that was -- her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil got to the house while they went from this poem that was being . they were only thing that it fast enough to one of paper and a pencil down into had to make it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and on the piece of that could .
in others to paint it was not fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem would through them and you missed it . they said it would keep talking about the country to and how they said -- <unk> another one day poet <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part i will never forget -- they said that it moments , there in which it 's almost over missed .
so , it runs the house and for the paper and the poem is through them and they 're with a right when it through them <unk> and then -- said they -- it was so when i 'd be with their other hand to reach and it to get you .
they got the poem in his tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on the kind of paper .
in these opportunities that came the poem is particularly ethical and intact on the paper on -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that was i thought this is an incredible -- that 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
that 's not at how my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to me to every day the same time up and sweat , i was struggling and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even to my <unk> i sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of them that 's also have done .
even i had to work , or ideas , from a source of me <unk> , i really do n't identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step with the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but let 's the contrary , actually mental health to balance ?
for me is the best part of living for how to this can actually create the musician , tom <unk> . i had to him a few years ago for a magazine interview .

but then he was getting older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a steppe super-highway , go to los angeles , . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a simple patch of a melody out of it , , how it in my inspirations are often is to a miserably hard is tangible . and he wants they have it 's gorgeous . he <unk> but he can you ca n't .
he has no amount of paper , he does n't have a pen , he does n't have a tape .
he 's starting point that old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm coming from this song on forever are tracking .
i 'm not good enough , i do it ''
but instead of panic for the to get , he heard just stopped .
he ended up all the <unk> and doing something completely new .
he glanced at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i car that ? ''
<unk> i so , when i could just a song goes down ?
if you really exist would come to a <unk> moment when i 'm going to you care about .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work itself . was still many times as dark as time , and the .
but the process and with the <unk> , it around , was salvaged when he 's genius from , it took , where he 's nothing more than when the place to and then leaving where he has become , came from . he realized that 's not a skilled , tormenting thing had to be .
it was a crowd , truly miraculous , bizarre about collaboration and there is a conversation and tom cruise and the alien , physical n't that 's tom 's been .
when i this story is it will have changed it a little bit , the way i worked and it 's got me , saved .

not just bad , but the bottom of all time .
i started to think i should pull this just <unk> .
but then i remembered it , just like tom in the free sky was talking and i tried it .
i was so my view from the manuscript , and spoke to comment on the one of empty the corner of space .
i spoke out loud , `` stop kowtowing to , you do you and i know them , if this book is not brilliant , is that 's not completely blew my fault is right ?
because you see that i do everything , i 've . i do n't have more than that .
if you get it so much we have would you got here show up and your of the deal air-quality standards .
okay if you do n't do -- you know what , the devil with it .
i 'm still further , because this is my job .
and i want to go to report was giving me to today for my bit of jobs here , ''
because ... ... the end , it 's how to follow . centuries ago , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music to gather around , for this were -- to <unk> .
this fixed prices were always been great , because the best dancers were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , and again , very rare , was something special . one of the performer , in fact she .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , such a performance have seen .
it was as the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a doorway to supplement . he did n't something different than he 's ever before has done -- unlike a nights earlier . but all on , together .
and very suddenly appeared he did n't know , no longer in human .
he was from up and from the bottom up and everything that lit up , through a divine fire .
when that at that happened to know the people what it was called it 's at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god <unk>
this is god , you know ?
some of historical footnote : when the <unk> <unk> conquer they took this practice with the way it changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer in spain , let 's impossible , something magic has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> great <unk> more elusive , because it is : a glimpse at the god .
and that 's amazing because we need this .
but , the tricky part is the next morning , if the dancer from ourselves up and you see that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in the wearing .
he 's just an aging mortal self with aching at . and maybe it will never again to these heights level-up .
and perhaps will never again a god 's name out , when he said , and around . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
it 's one of the <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it does not quite so full of the anguish if you in the first we did n't have to the most critical aspects of mortality of you move it .
if you might just think that you a loaner are -- of ways we 've source for a <unk> time your life , to someone else 's being passed , if you ready to do .
if we start , that 's going to think it changes all this .
so what i began to think and i certainly , in the last several months , as i was the book working , that soon be that is , as the most dangerous , scary , and expectations <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always tell ourselves to , when i talk about it going to do is : i did n't afraid .
do n't be feeling disheartened ,
just do your job .
she was going to continue for your contribution that is worth it may be .
if your job that dance is dance .
if the dumb on genius , that you had the side of really is to decide , for just a moment , yet from the miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
, and if not dance , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you despite all this .
i think it and i feel that that we should teach .
<unk> ! '' for you despite all this , just for you to the mere human love and the <unk> have , that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> .
last year i these slides just shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , to close to three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but that 's not going strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem of , because it 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense of is the arctic <unk> the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide , i want to show , is a <unk> to the past 25 years happened .
this <unk> , it 's labeled correctly .
as you see it 's on the dark to . this is the annual ice in the wintertime ; and it -- in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which one of the body here <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here , here will be gone .
this is a problem , because the rise in the frozen shores of this is the arctic ocean <unk> , it large amounts of <unk> carbon sitting there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes and methane being implemented it .
comparing with the amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this will double , when we have this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in some and lakes in alaska , methane from ourselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska 's with one another task to a different and the last winter time traveling .
wow !
she 's good . the question is how it makes us through .
and a reason is this enormous heat up in greenland from the north .
now , this is a <unk> .
but the volume are much larger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the heavens through <unk> up here keeps flowing you the ocean .
those rivers , rapidly to .
the other end of the planet , and antarctica , the biggest ice in the planet .
last month had signed up , researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , about a couple <unk> up is it 's very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea , like the greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> ice , you see the top of lakes , a few years ago glaciers were .
40 percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> of this snowmelt from .
in the andes is this glacier the <unk> this , the city .
the as well , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this is in the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read have , are seriously .
these <unk> in the world to play a dramatic improvement on fire .
and the challenger disaster in the world have in a really <unk> and that had never done . degree gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of sufism , you can see , it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced at all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
take , the area of the eastern pacific right , , from the american continent west and both of indian <unk> , where it 's a go decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , to logging , which is about 20 percent of mind , is the burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless , biggest problem .
the united states are one or the largest <unk> , china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change .
here are the , the last few years , painted by , with some green are alternatives , and proposed .
they go there 's a political engagement in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent some way to clean coal to apply to herself , a contradiction in terms , is .
this reminded me of something .
the christmas around them off , in my home , and in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> seen in the news .
this is in our whole country of the <unk> can promote america .
so that happened to christmas .
one of the commercials on the coal industries , to look at christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy to begin .
it 's in a skin and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day of clean .
he is affordable eyeglasses and <unk> , and the time remain in wages , bread .
this is the source of the coal in west virginia .
the most miners , is the leader of massey coal .
now , i want to a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry -- this , they do n't know , what they talk .
so has the alliance for climate two were campaigning against the in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> we see the climate change as a serious at risk for our business .
so it , we us to the top <unk> , a significant <unk> spending to a <unk> on the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is that coal is not much .
we believe it 's clean -- and it smells , well
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
let them . take this us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about this .
so , let 's a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal of the main reasons for the global warming is , i clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
you look , it right , , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally woke up the positive alternative to do with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
the red thread , these all together , is our dependence of <unk> fuel , dirty or coal and foreign oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solutions to us from this <unk> able to free .
provide america with 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years
a plan , america back to work to us safer , to do and to help the global warming continues to stop .
at a solution , big enough is our to solve problems .
provide in new , you find more out .
this is the last thing .
it 's a matter of a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of old , dirty diapers of fuel , our world one , to decrease .
the future is this wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , well from well-paid jobs to create .
provide america . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african health is , `` if you be fast to go alone .
if you very far come to go together .
we need to be far come out , quickly .
thank you .
i want to begin with them to ask , of the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized how to the hands out and <unk> , <unk> pick up and moves , they learned in fact , to think and problems through the understanding and change spatialized of what 's going to solve .
this is thinking is closely with being connected to fit a lot of our environment understand .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real word objects -- and with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder , if we use computers were , instead of <unk> , as a digital <unk> on a flat canvas moving along ... ... what would be if we do with both hands were able and data physically take and you so many could , as we want ?
this question was that 's emotional , that we 're going to explore the answer to try and <unk> .
short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can start with , the be moved , you can each other way , they can explore motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they 're physically , why you how can convert them through the stick out of the hands and access can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of questions to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools labor and be a consciousness for them to each other , recognize and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , we can with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll begin with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , is that point it ; if i asked him in the other <unk> , and it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits , each other , right .
i turn it so next to put that makes that your interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , they find that again , we can think about beating .
and they feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting a result of interactions , we 're going to see it started to everyday gestures on data to be , like a color so to them into how to -- this <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them , bringing color , in the middle to pour , then mixed it will .
if we might overdo it , we can a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers , i do with a simple <unk> literally .
this is a game with words , this kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically you make each round , every <unk> to <unk> letters and as you 're trying words to form , they 'll be about a dictionary 'd checked .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and has a new impediment—from avoiding and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some of the kids on a trip to the media lab to them . i could you 're going to say , it 's try and i have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
an interesting fact , of applications , is that the people 's not a lot of them to give them .
it you need to tell is `` you see words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people , it 's see .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
and it turns out that he 's the <unk> only after stack it to .
so for him , they were only can convert .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a my for language learner develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the way into the notion that he the <unk> the table on top , this figure shows .
here it the sun is an instantaneous .
the sun goes on
now make it 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yes !
and he the <unk> shake and they just line them it 's the characters are so ...
i brought his own story unto ourselves .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example , for that today i 'm at it to show that 's a <unk> for <unk> that recently we 've developed and the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , singing and they were drums operate .
each has four different variations . you can choose , which you to use .
and you can this sounds in the sequence of -- that 's very , again in any kind can arrange them .
and <unk> you a , by just a <unk> to a <unk> holding .
there are effects , you live can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound and abundance tends to then to hire .
and then , actually effects , at the matter volume , you on the entire sequence gets .
so a look .
we start , where we the <unk> in two <unk> -- and this in a variety of them , you know , and a little bit more about the voice also .
now in -- i have a bass , it .
now i 'm still a play drums .
and now i 'll just hook the filter up with the drums , so i the effect on can control .
i can measure the sequence or speed , by that i felt at the one or other direction <unk> .
and now i 'll just hook the filter , with the bass , for a little bit more expression .
i can the sequence of as they 're going to change .
so i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but can truly improvising . they meanwhile , you do or down .

thank you .
so as you can see is that 's my desire in new <unk> to develop , better to fit , like our brains and body work .
and today i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities of going to show , what we in our work .
the idea , who i them with the way to leave , is that we have the verge , this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , that our world to say , our needs to .
thank you
i 'm in conversations with them .
